"Why Ethereum? Some thoughts on the value, potential and end goals of smart contract enabled blockchains","Why have smart contract blockchains? why not just have a centralized authority be trusted and elected and have them govern?   


If your civilization can afford it, blockchains are better. while more complex and energy intensive they are formal and incorruptible which are good traits for systems of rules. the question ""why blockchains? why not a trusted governing body?"" is analogous to, in ancient times, asking ""why write down the laws? why not just have good leaders and have them make all the decisions?"". the idea of a good king is a simple and intuitive way to have a governance system but history demonstrates that t in practice this governance system often goes awry: ""power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely"". it's better to write down your laws so your can at least cross reference the actions of your governing executives with the letter of the law. perhaps you even develop a separate system of governance that checks to see if the executives are playing by the letter of the law. also having laws that are written down allows people to have some sense of what to expect from their leaders and society.

&amp;#x200B;

the promise of blockchain (specifically ones that allow for smart contracts) is to elevate governance from written law to one of deterministic code. Ethereum, if successful, will change how humans govern themselves and allow for more complex human social systems to emerge and interoperate.",ethereum,1619313732,ch1rh0,24,1,True,2021-04-24

"If a reliable L2 option is available to use, there is really no reason to be complaining about Ethereum's high gas fees - for SO MANY applications, L2 is already here, why not start using it?","I have no affiliation Polygon, or any other L2 groups, but good lord are these L2 options impressive to me. 

If you're not using it, but it has ""a dapp for that"", why are you avoiding it?

I'm giving some examples, but I'm in no way married to these. If you have other awesome L2s, I ask you (**no, beg you**) to add it to comments so people can start using L2 and stop complaining about high gas fees.

My example, Polygon (matic) is working now. [Here's nice write up](https://medium.com/coinmonks/polygon-matic-could-it-win-the-eth-scaling-race-2c8b4e9baf51). They're trying to be ""Amazon Web Services"" for ETH2 with [two L2 options now](https://polygon.technology/), more coming, with a plan to pool liquidity between L2. 

It is growing fast, with some well known players and services:

* [Opensea NFTs](https://matic.opensea.io/), yup a polygon option is in beta
* Non-custodial liquidity protocols, [AAVE now has a polygon integration](https://app.aave.com/markets)
* Decentralized exchange, [quickswap has been solid](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap) (can't look back to Uniswap anymore, although I would if they'd get their butts on Polygon)
* Apparently there is a 1000 projects building on Polygon, and certainly, [their twitter](https://twitter.com/0xPolygon) is like a running list of partners, it's pretty insane. [Go Here](https://awesomepolygon.com/) to see some that are on the list

Polygon is just one L2, but it's the largest growing L2 ecosystem I know. Again POST MORE in comments, I'm excited to play around with them. If you're not using L2, WHY?

$XCEL,"XCel is an automated market maker (AMM) aggregator and yield farming solution providing decentralised loans secured through XCel on Binance Smart Chain. The project was created to improve the availability of credit on BSC, as we felt the options for decentralised loans were limited within the BSC ecosystem when compared to Ethereum.

* Decentralized yield farming (at launch)
* Flash loans, backed by staked assets with profits of loans distributed to XCel holders (post audit)
* NFT's used to facilitate ownership of P2P asset backed loans (long term directional goal)

NO PRESALE, NO AIRDROP, NO BULLSHIT

As I write this $XCel currently has 44 holders with the plan for natural growth and demand unlike other shitcoins which has then caused many to lose money. So get in early and join this great project :)

Trouble withdrawing from DeFi App using Ledger,"I originally this in r/ledgerwaller but there's about 2 people on that sub.

I'm having trouble withdrawing from Yearn using my newly purchased Ledger Nano X. Previous to the Ledger I held Yearn Finance's custom tokens (e.g. yvUSDC, yvWETH) in my MetaMask wallet. When I got the Ledger I transferred them over from the MetaMask. No problems here. I can now connect my Ledger when using [yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance) and can view all my balances. (yay! - I love staring at them)

I now want to withdraw from the Yearn vault. I connect my Ledger, select the asset I want to withdraw, select ""Max"", and click withdraw. Now the transaction pops up on the ledger and asks me to confirm. I scroll through the smart contract address, the gas fee, and the amount of ETH - but the amount of ETH is always 0. It's asking me to approve or reject withdrawing 0 ETH. I've tried withdrawing different amounts and always its 0 ETH on the ledger to approve. 

Do I need to use LedgerLive to approve the transactions too?

Any help is appreciated. I'm closely monitoring gas prices to withdraw and deposit into another vault and have missed a few opportunities already.",ethereum,1619141089,Apeshatt,6,1,True,2021-04-22
Figuring out where I sent my Ethereum," I am doing 2017-2020 crypto taxes. I have mostly everything figured out except one big ETH address which I cannot find info on where it was sent or what it was exchanged for.

Back in July of 2019, I withdrew 15 ETH from Gemini and sent it to the address: [https://etherscan.io/address/0xdc54fbfaed6eCb9b0de07cDfC9893800aD545719](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdc54fbfaed6eCb9b0de07cDfC9893800aD545719)

From this address, it was transferred to this address:

[https://etherscan.io/address/0x7454a609ea877f37fa6d42feca76a8f18de841c7](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7454a609ea877f37fa6d42feca76a8f18de841c7)

The second address has 28k+ transactions. It seems like this might be some exchange, and the first txid transaction was for taking out a fee?

I have entered in all my APIs and CSVs. During the time of this transaction, the ETH amount was worth around $3k. I do not have any other transactions around (after) these txid that could be tokens swapped. I either have 15 ETH somewhere or I have some kind of tokens that I swapped for. Can someone please help me out here? How do I figure out who the Ethereum address belongs to that the 15 ETH was sent? Thank you!",ethereum,1619141323,IamDoge1,2,1,True,2021-04-22

Seriously can't believe how slow implementation is taking to lower gas fees. It's disgusting and disgraceful.,"Where is poster child Vitalik these days? Sure seems awfully quiet while the majority of the crypto community screams foul and protests in disgust over the ever increasing ethereum networks gas fees. 

Almost 150 USD at time of writing. One. Hundred. And. Fifty. Dollars..... Is this some kind of cruel joke? I have to literally spend almost 3% to trade some tokens. Was this seriously never thought out at the time of ethereums creation? It makes no sense to me that ANY of the original developers thought of, or hand the hindsight, to mitigate these types of fees with a largely used and adopted network. Did they all think eth wouldn't catch on? Wouldn't see as much use? Wouldn't have nearly the amount of usage? Seems like some pretty piss poor planning IMHO. 

What else did they unforsee? And why the hell is it taking them so long to implement a solution? It's been what, two years? With another two year potential before any of these fees are mitigated and or have some sort of palpable solution? Sorry for venting, but ethereum is the one of the largest reasons why our beloved ecosystem is being held back, and progression is being grinded to a halt. All cylinders where firing at maximum speed.... And then eth just had to throw its shitty wrench into the engine bay. I mean.... For christ sakes, when Binance produces a solution that blows ethereum out of the water, its incredibly sad and disgraceful at this point in time. Centralized or not, ethereum needs to get its shit together. I love this chain, but how long can you love something that doesn't love you back?

Are gas fees high because miners are utilising Flashbots to take advantage of MEV by exploiting Mempool sequences? THE AMOUNT OF FLASHBOTS ON ETHEREUM IS BECOMING MAINSTREAM?,"Miners Extractable Value becoming a big part of the network:



Arbitrage hopefuls are scanning the eth Mempool



Once multiple entity try to outbid each other, the miners benefit



Miners are becoming frontrunners as they can sequence transactions



This is called MEV (Miner Extractable Value.)



Importantly, the Optimism system enables the capture and repurposing of MEV.



By splitting the sequencers (auctioning the right to become a sequencer to the free market) and validators (whom validate transactions and add to Optimism Layer 2) The right to capture MEV is then auctioned off, creating an equitable cycle.



Just as frontrunners attempted to outbid each other‚Äôs transactions to capture MEV, those who wish to capture MEVA are forced to bid for the right to sequence transactions, and ultimately hands this value off to the auctioneer. That auctioneer is Optimism, and the Optimism team intends to enable the redirecting of this captured value to parties that were never going to be able to access it in the first place, but arguably should have: The developers who built the contracts in the first place!



Flashbots is an R&amp;D organization working on mitigating the negative externalities of Ethereum MEV. Today 5 mining pools are running its MEV-geth software, which in total account for &gt;12% of the Ethereum hashrate. Miners running MEV-geth have seen an average increase in income of 0.13 ETH per block so far in March, which is also a ~3x increase MoM. In total, miners collected 174 ETH in Flashbots fees in February, up by more than 6x the amount collected in January.""



A recent study that aimed to quantify the so-called miner-extractable value (MEV) in Ethereum in the last 6 months shed some light on the scale of bot activity in Ethereum. The study found that bots extracted 0.34 ETH of MEV per block through arbitrage and liquidations. Moreover, the study found that 18.7% of MEV extracted by bots is paid to miners through gas fees which makes up 3.7% of all transaction fees. Undoubtedly, this implies that the scale of bot activity on Ethereum is becoming mainstream. To provide comprehensive front-running protection, bloXroute introduced a private transactions service, in collaboration with a group of mining pools.",ethereum,1619154585,futureinallitsglory,0,1,True,2021-04-22

ü§ñ 99 NFT Robots or how to get free Tesla supporting NFT-movement,"Hey, everyone üëã

I'm here to announce the new era of fintech with a pinch of charity.

Couple of months ago, when all the NFT movement started to become bolder, we had come to idea, which realisation will help the NFT thing grow.

We came up with a challenge, according to which we will release 1 unique crypto-art per day for 99 days.

But the most important thing is that we believe in the future of cryptocurrencies and therefore everyone who buys at least 1 copy of 1 drop will have the opportunity to win a Tesla Model S. 

Why Tesla? Because it can be bought for bitcoin!

**Who we are**

We are creators and creative designers of Neobank Chatex, which is one of the fastest growing cryptocurrency services on Telegram. It is a comprehensive service integrated messenger, which has been offering reliable and easy access to cryptocurrency to users from all over the world for more than 3 years.

![video](kgdjgv83ahu61)

The year 2020 has been extremely eventful for Chatex. In addition to intense activity in the CIS countries, the company also presented its product in the markets of India, Turkey, Georgia, and Latin America. As a result, since the beginning of 2020, about 190 thousand new members have joined the Chatex community, and now their total number is almost 300 thousand people.

In 2021, from a cryptocurrency exchange in the Chatex messenger, it has grown to the service of a new technological type with its own system of instant and free transfers, a multi-currency wallet, an integrated trading platform and the Chatex Pay payment system. Already this year, Chatex will become a cross-platform service, develop its own mobile application and integrate a cryptocurrency deposit system.

Considering the background of such activity and outlined plans for the nearest future, participation in the development of digital art is not something unexpected. The NFT market entry becomes a natural vector for Chatex's development. The company has many thoughtful plans and new advances ahead that will help strengthen the liquidity of NFT Chatex Robots.

ETH 2.0 Staking still possible?,"Hi Guys,

My question, can I still participate in ETH2.0 staking? Since I basically just hodl I thought, why not staking and checked binance. They give you the option to stake to ETH 2.0, but somehow they give you their native BETH Token as reward which can be exchanged 1:1 to ETH. Besides it sounding really sketchy, I do not want to support Binance in any way. My question, is it still possible to stake ETH via Ledger? Or is the Binance ETH 2.0 recommendable?

I am warming up to EIP-1559,"I don't like the ""punish miners"" stuff that was written in the EIP. In my view, miners and ASIC companies haven't done anything wrong. So seeing that said irked me. I've also said in the past, and very much still agree with, that miners are on borrowed time. That proof of stake was to be implemented very early on in ethereum, but there have been significantly long delays. This is the reason I purchased eth in 2015, instead of mining, because I didn't believe mining would last long and therefore be a bad investment. (I was a miner of litecoin for 2 years prior to ethereum) Miners have had many years of profits due to the delays and once PoS is released, it's time for them to move on. Hopefully voluntarily and hopefully those miner's who believe in ethereum transition to staking or supporting ethereum in another way. They've had ample time to plan for this.  
  
To expand more on why I don't believe miners have done anything wrong. Number 1, I haven't seen any evidence of miners acting maliciously on the ethereum network. Some miners and ASIC mfgs have had heated arguments, but as far as malicious network activity, I haven't seen it. In my opinion, it's more of the ""miners are bad"" crowd that have acted maliciously and attacked miners. Number 2, ASIC mfgs and miners are operating in a capitalist free market. If there is a chance to make profit mining or a demand for ASICs, they capitalize on it. I believe that's fair and a good part of the free market. Capitalism voluntarily fills market demand.  
  
That's why I stick up for miners and businesses in general. Not because I'm a miner or in cahoots with miners, but because I love free market capitalism. That's what I stand up for. And businesses really get a lot of crap from people these days.  
  
Now, as far as my criticism of complex and not well understood fee mechanics. I would like to see more publication of research in how EIP-1559 affects this. Maybe some of this already exists and/or I should spend more time thinking about it myself. I know that I am warming up deflating eth. I am also leaning towards being okay with burning the gas fee or maybe burning part of it to accomplish this. I'm trying to think if there are any negatives to doing this, but not coming up with any at the moment. I'm also still not convinced EIP-1559 will actually lower transaction fees. But I also don't think that is something it needs to do, because there are other things in the future of ethereum that will do so.  
  
But, overall, I am warming up to EIP-1559 and to looking at it through more ""accepting eyes"". And anticipate myself being fully okay with it by the time it gets released for acceptance. Not to say I have any say in it getting approved or not. Just letting you guys know the state of my thoughts on it, as I've been very much against it previously.",ethereum,1618888889,Anthony-AltcoinXP,13,1,True,2021-04-19

[idea] dual-contract tokens,"A dual-contract token is an ERC-20 token that has an ERC-223 version. The ERC-223 version will be deployed by the original ERC-20 token contract and will have unlimited token spending approval from any wallets. This is achieved by changing the ERC-20 `transferFrom()` logic to give the ERC-223 version unlimited token spending approval from any wallets. The ERC-223 version will call the `transferFrom()` function in the original ERC-20 token contract when transferring funds, instead of modifying a balance sheet, and it will check the `allowance()` function in the original ERC-20 token contract when using `transferFrom()` in the ERC-223 version instead of checking allowance database.

"Scalability Race - Update 2, Late April 2021","Didn't think I would post an update a mere 2 weeks after the initial post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mjyvxz/ethereum\_scalability\_race\_april\_2021\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mjyvxz/ethereum_scalability_race_april_2021_update/). I highly recommend reading that post for a primer on 

But with the ETHGlobal Scaling Ethereum summit currently ongoing, we have tons of news on rollups. It took a few days, but I finally managed to get through the key presentations. Definitely worth watching if you have a cool 7 hours to spare: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsksm\_by7LQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsksm_by7LQ)

Or, here are some highlights: 

**Matter Labs** [**announced details about zkPorter**](https://medium.com/matter-labs/zkporter-a-breakthrough-in-l2-scaling-ed5e48842fbf)**.** Essentially, this is a Validium-like solution - a ZK rollup architecture but data availability is off-chain. Where it improves on Validium is that the data availability committee is partially decentralized with its own proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. They haven't released details about the consensus mechanism yet, but we know there's slashing mechanisms involved and its strong implied to be real proof-of-stake, not delegated-type like pretty much every non-ethereum L1. zkSync 2.0 uses a Volition-like architecture where developers and/or users can seamlessly choose between Rollup or zkPorter modes for their desired level of security vs fees trade-off. 

While you do compromise on security with zkPorter, **it still offers far superior scalability, decentralization and security characteristics than any alternate non-ethereum L1**. The worst case scenario is a super-majority 67% of zkPorter validators collude to freeze your funds - but it also freezes their own stake. 

I have one strong criticism for Matter Labs, though - their marketing here is tone-deaf, by dubiously antagonizing optimistic rollups. Like I mentioned above, what they should really do is aggressively market against alternate L1s. There's currently $250 billion+ misallocated into many of these ghost chains, and almost all of them don't hold a candle to a programmable ZK rollup in terms of scalability, security or decentralization, let alone all three. By adding zkPorter to the mix, we now have scalability that's completely impossible with L1s unless you centralize your validation to supercomputers like Solana is doing - at this point, it's no longer a decentralized, trustless network.

Of course, Matter Labs is not alone - **StarkWare is building a similar solution for StarkNet**, where they will have a data availability consensus mechanism to add to Validium. However, StarkNet is only planning to get there in 2022, while zkSync 2.0 will potentially have the entire stack live on mainnet by late 2021. There's plenty of exciting progress for StarkNet before then, though. In May, we will have the StarkNet single-app rollups - what they call Planets - live on testnet. Once Planets are done, anyone will be able to release their own arbitrary code using the Cairo language, on their own single-app rollup. Where it gets interesting is Constellations, where it brings a multi-app rollup this is due to release in late 2021. 

On the point of Validium data availability consensus mechanisms, it's important that data sharding (what was previously ""Phase 1"" and now due after The Merge) will bring massive data availability to L1. However, I can still see zkPorter/Validium being relevant to potentially accelerate low-value high-throughput applications like gaming or social networks (which are currently impossible using any blockchain tech) to the tune of millions of TPS. 

**Optimism and Arbitrum** both have their public release-candidate testnets out now. Optimism is taking a more conservative approach with guardrails and whitelists for contract deployment on mainnet. A common misconception is that ""Optimism is delayed till at least July"". In reality, they have been live on mainnet since January. As per their whitelist approach, we'll see Synthetix to gradually move more of their functionality over to L2 over the next couple of months, and I expect to see Uniswap V3, Maker Protocol and a handful of others join them there. The July timeline is for when Optimism turns off the whitelists and anyone will be able to deploy smart contracts. It's also important to note that this whitelist is for developers only - users can freely use Optimistic Ethereum. Meanwhile, Arbitrum's key advantages over Optimism are they have no such whitelists and their testnets and upcoming mainnet deployment will be open to all from day one. Arbitrum also supports BLS signature aggregation natively already - the same cryptographic innovation that makes &gt;120,000 validators possible on beacon chain today can also be used to dramatically improve batching and scalability. Of course, Optimism has the industry support at this time, but it'll be curious to see this space develop. 

Optimism's approach of aligning its clients with Geth should mean it's the most Ethereum-like environment of the bunch. They fully plan to implement L1 innovations like EIP-1559, statelessness to further enhance Optimistic Ethereum. Interestingly, ""zkEVM"" is in the works for Optimism. Though Karl (whose enthusiasm is forever infectious) doesn't go into details there - it is pretty clear the Optimism team is aware of the benefits of ZK rollups and fully plan to leverage the tech in the future in some form. 

Finally, Polygon is also working on both optimistic and ZK rollups, and other non-rollup solutions, though their roadmap remains pretty vague for now. 

**Summing up**: zkSync 2.0 may be stealing the show, but they need to prove their tech on testnet - which happens in May. We'll get a clearer picture then. Of course, Optimism is a force to be reckon with, and likely where most blue-chip DeFi projects will deploy first over the next 3 months or so. It's the closest to Ethereum L1, and for complex smart contracts that wish to maintain as close to like-for-like parallel deployments on L1 and L2 as Uniswap and Synthetix do, it's going to be the preferred option. Arbitrum could potentially be the first publicly available programmable rollup, and is still very closely aligned with L1 with the sweet benefits of BLS signature aggregation. StarkNet's tech is already proven with DeversiFi, dYdX and ImmutableX live on mainnet, and their methodical approach may prove pragmatic long-term. While zkSync 2.0 and StarkNet may diverge from L1 EVM more than Optimism, it also opens up potential benefits of L2-specific efficiency and scalability. I can totally see deployments for things like non-financial applications that skip L1 entirely and live purely on a ZK rollup and perhaps even on zkPorter/Validium. Indeed - this is what ImmutableX is doing. 

Overall, the Scalability Race continues to heat up. It is still early, and each of these players have their own sets of strengths and weaknesses.

Argument with professor about Fat Protocol Thesis. Please weigh in:,"


**My argument:** Look at the last crypto cycle. How many coins that were top ten in 2017 are top ten now? There‚Äôs two: BTC and ETH. But, here‚Äôs the shocking thing, if you expand the list to the top 50, how many are ERC? 33 are. Not surprising, but ERC-based tokens are starting to dominate the mid-tier and slowly moving up the list.

**Her argument:** This is proof that Ethereum is not benefiting from *fat protocol thesis,* and that the thesis is wrong.

**My counter argument:** If that were true, ETH should not have the valuation it does, approximately double what is was last time, and it shouldn‚Äôt have the exponential transaction volume. Clearly it‚Äôs benefiting.

**Her deathblow:** The price is due to speculation.

**My final rebuttal:** Even WBTC (wrapped bitcoin) is a top 20 coin now, which is a predatory behavior, because it means the Ethereum protocol is starting to eat things not natively built on it. I then compared email to the USPS and said email hasn‚Äôt killed the USPS, but has taken a much of what would‚Äôve been its business (the usps has come close to insolvency many times). Also I invoked USDC‚Äôs growth, noting that it‚Äôs now 28% of Tether‚Äôs mkt cap and gaining. That was unthinkable two years ago. 

**Her dismissal:** Speculation can do incredible things. 

I wasn‚Äôt satisfied how the argument ended and I‚Äôd like the board to weigh-in on this please! Clearly something is going on, even if we‚Äôre not certain yet. My longterm view is that if gas fees collapse and staking becomes available to the masses (two promises of 2.0) then ETH/ERC can consume (or straight make burnt toast of) everything not BTC or a privacy coin.

Argent and the jokes on me,"So i tried Argent after a lot of people and pages have been suggesting it only to realize, that i have been immensely scammed by this organization, here is my story:

around 10 bucks are being added to my transaction for transaction fees as well as the message that the activation fee will be taken from my first deposit, sounden legit so i paid around 60EUR with my VISA.  
Now comes the great part: The money got sent, i supposedly receive my Ether, only to realize that there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING i can do with my ETH, i can't send it, i can't exchange it, i can't sell it, all because my account isn't yet activated in order to do so, the support dead end tells me, that they are charging NINTY US DOLLARS additionally in order to even use my account.  


now i don't care if I misread anything or got something wrong in the process and it is irrelevant because 90 fucking bucks for an activation fee is absolutely mad insane bullcrap.

Maybe my best investment in 2021,"I stumbled across the project StudentCoin. Seems to be the biggest ICO 2021. Maybe my best investment in 2021.

The project is unique in the crypto space and if it starts to get more attention it can become a very popular coin.

- Anybody can create their own token on top of StudentCoin via a web interface. No programming skills required. 
- If you stake StudentCoin (STC) you earn from all transactions of the tokens on top of STC. 
- Students are the future and bring innovation and proper use cases.
- They are planning to build an education program to make students early learn about blockchain.. so they probably will use STC to build interesting projects on top of it.
¬† 
In two weeks they just launched their wallet, mobile app and announced 3 exchange listings.

The team confirmed that STC is going to be listed on 9 new exchanges from the top 50 (a few from them are top 20 and top 10) from May 2021.

Their presale is currently live and 145 of 150 phases are finished.

A review is nothing without negative points and criticisms:

- Communication of the team could be improved

- There is a lot of FUD.. The team could just clear this up better and comment on all the criticisms. To improve that they are planning to make a team interview series from next week to be closer to the community.

- The 500 universities are not all real partners.. they just have students from those universities as supporter.. its not clear which universities are partners

The ico price is still really low with 0.021 USD.

A small portion of the circulating supply is beeing traded on CoinTiger and Uniswap for 0.03 USD already and went up to $0.07 some days ago.

StudentCoin is already on CoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/student-coin/

StudentCoin Twitter: https://mobile.twitter.com/studentcoinorg

There are three options to participate:

- buy STC via Credit Card

- send ETH from your MetaMask wallet

- send any crypto to the Coinbase Commerce payment method

I just found out you can buy the coinbase packages but send more than the package price.. you will receive the correct amount of STC even if you overpay the package.

I recommend using Litecoin due to its low transaction fees.

Coinbase Commerce works also for US investors.

Unique Recover Ether Question,"Howdy all! Hoping someone can help. I'm a newbie to Crypto. Back in 2017 I bought some Ether on a whim. I bought it with Coinbase and transferred it to my Mist Ether wallet (I had no idea what I was doing).

I remember back it seemed like it never fully made it to the wallet. It would download forever and never quite get there.

I recently gained access to my old Coinbase account, and it confirms that the Ether was sent. I then double checked with Etherscan and it shows the transfer as complete. When I boot up my old hard-drive with the Mist wallet (I verified that the address was indeed correct) but it does not have the Ether, nor does it ever show in the transaction history that it ever received it. Now Mist wallet is no more.

Reduced Ethermine Payouts,"Sorry all if this is a ridiculous question, but I've been reading the Ethermine FAQs and agreements but i cant get any info (or at least cant figure out) how payouts are calculated in general.

Obviously the price of Eth has shot up so i'm wondering if the payouts to the pool are somehow tied to a dollar value at any given moment?

Some Tips For Successful Cryptocurrency Trading,"To become a profitable digital currency trader, you need to do so much more than simply plan your trades; trade your plans or minimise losses. In order to increase your odds of succeeding in the highly volatile crypto markets, you need to start by understanding the fundamentals of trading and specifically trading digital assets. For example, it‚Äôs common knowledge that as a cryptocurrency trader or investor one must almost always aim to buy low and sell high or sometimes even buy high and sell higher. However, this is easier said than done. Timing the markets is no easy feat.¬†

There‚Äôs a lot that comes with trading including fundamental and technical analysis, risk management, and other profit maximising and risk reducing trading strategies and techniques. In this piece, we‚Äôll cover just three simple things you can do to increase your chances of having success trading or investing in cryptocurrencies.¬†

**1) Have Clear Objectives, Goals or Targets**¬†

Building a profitable cryptocurrency portfolio requires a trader to have well-defined goals. As a crypto trader, it‚Äôs important to define your investment time horizon. This means that if you‚Äôre not planning on retiring in the near future, you may want to have a portfolio that includes longer-term investments. For that reason, you should always ensure that the type of trading you choose to do complements the goals you wish to realise and is aligned with reinforcing trading principles such as ‚Äì in this case ‚Äì taking long positions on assets that your analysis shows have long-term potential even though realising gains can be protracted.

If your goals are longer-term, you may also want to, for instance, analyse the market cycle and asset performance and how that relates to the utility or use case of the crypto asset, the supply &amp; demand mechanics, the blockchain ecosystem on which that tokenized digital asset is issued and its development. Furthermore, you also want to understand how those variables are factored into the price value of the asset you‚Äôre targeting for accumulation.¬†

Assuming that you want to buy the bottom, then it‚Äôs probably wise to set your buy orders to execute when the token price is at historical lows and then [hodl](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp) those crypto tokens until such a time that the asset begins to appreciate in value or the market gathers momentum in an upward trajectory before selling. When the market is bullish or the token price is approaching or reaches new all-time highs, you systematically sell off as the price rises in order to dispose of the asset as the market tops.¬†

Ultimately, your investing approach is what informs how you choose to trade the market and the strategy you employ whether that‚Äôs Scalping, Force, or Inversion strategies in day trading for example. Therefore, it‚Äôs important to have clarity of purpose and vision. When Charlie Munger, who is indeed a great investor, even though he is not a fan of digital currencies was asked why people can‚Äôt think clearly about investing or decisions in their lives in general ‚Äì his response was ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt think a lot about sex and gambling either. The standard human condition is a lot of miscognition. To address this you can ‚Äútake advantage of other people and improve your own life by eliminating your miscognitions.‚Äù¬†

**2) Determine your risk tolerance**

When trading cryptocurrencies, it‚Äôs necessary to establish the levels of risk you‚Äôre willing to take. You need to figure out your risk comfort level relative to what you can afford. In general, the longer you have to invest, the bigger risk you can take. Also different types of trading styles present different levels of risk. Leverage trading for instance, is considered high risk trading. Nonetheless, without risk, markets become predictable and value creation becomes difficult if the risk factor is eliminated since risk plays a crucial role in assigning the value of an asset. In order to appropriately gauge your risk tolerance as an investor in the digital currency market, you have to have a good understanding of the broad spectrum of risks inherent in the market. Some of the risks associated with trading cryptocurrencies include:¬†

* Government interference or regulation¬†
* Hacks and scams
* Market manipulation by [crypto whales](https://decentralised.africa/crypto-whales-sharks-why-we-should-care-but-not-be-scared/)

These and other risk factors play a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of the market. In order to protect your capital, you need to know when to take profit and how to set up stop loss orders, utilise a [trailing stop loss](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/trailing-stop-loss.asp) or trailing take profit. These tools are essential for protecting your capital, limiting your losses and increasing your gains. Ultimately, it‚Äôs important to fully understand [cryptocurrency trading risks](https://decentralised.africa/understanding-how-to-manage-crypto-trading-risks/).¬†

**3) Practice ‚Äì Doesn‚Äôt Make You Perfect, But It Gives You An Advantage**¬†

The savvy trader today does not necessarily have to learn everything from experience as far as the dos and don‚Äôts of crypto trading or investing. There‚Äôs always that heuristic element which inevitably comes with trading and investing practice, but with so many technologies at our disposal, there‚Äôs no reason why as a novice trader you should not at the very least test your trading ideas before risking real money by jumping straight into executing live trades.¬†

Many platforms such as [Bybit](https://www.bybit.com/app/register?ref=7kPPw), [BitMex](https://www.bitmex.com/register/8CZWk0), [BitMart](https://www.bitmart.com/en?r=PbCyaw) and eToro offer prospective traders the tools to practice their trading strategies by backtesting, which allows you the trader, to simulate your trading strategy utilising historical data to generate results and analyze risk and profitability before risking your actual capital.

NOOB REQUESTS ADVICE,"Hello! Noob here... I‚Äôm reading as much as I can but it‚Äôs all moving so fast! Ok so here‚Äôs the gist:
A few weeks ago I put $700 into ETH when it was around $1600on. It turned into $900 pretty quickly - a friend advised me to see at around $2100 and buy again when it dipped back down to $1600. Obviously that has not happened and I want to slap myself for listening to him too soon as I could have made a few more $100s at this point. My question is: When should I buy again? My instinct tells me if it dips to 2k I should move. 
Second question is - What else to buy? I have a few thousand to invest in crypto and would like to just sit on for a while.

"Berlin gave us some DoS resistance, time to raise the gas limit","So Berlin fixes a bunch of DoS vectors, and the network is busy and full of great stuff. There's loads of new interest in Ethereum, it's a real shame to turn away people without a preexisting ETH stash. Everyone is working  hard getting projects working on L2 systems but the best stuff isn't yet done, and in any case we still need move things to those systems, and that takes L1 gas.

State will grow but SSDs are cheap and easier than ever to add; PCs nowadays usually have either an M2 SSD slot or a PCIE slot that you can turn into an M2 slot with an adaptor, just pop it in there like a stick of RAM and boom, you have 1TB of fast storage for barely over $100, or 0.034 ETH in our money. Initial sync time isn't a complete non-issue but you only do it once, and sync methods are getting better all the time.

Private Charter (ENS-PCT),"
It‚Äôs no wonder the attraction my cheap dad had for Ethereum when I explained to him what *fat protocol theory* is. For those that don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs this: 

The internet is a protocol. *Value* moves from the protocol layer to its application layer. Google, Amazon, etcetera, are its applications. They‚Äôve become very valuable over the years and quite frankly, show no signs of contracting. In cryptocurrency however, value flows in the opposite direction. It flows from the application layer, to the protocol. Thus the name: *fat protocol thesis.* It‚Äôs easy to imagine then, why Ethereum is positioned better than any other cryptocurrency because of what‚Äôs built on it. And I‚Äôll posit, that if gas fees fall and staking becomes available to the masses (2.0), it‚Äôs likely to make burnt toast of every crypto not ERC related (excluding stablecoins, bitcoin, and privacy coins), unless those protocols velvet fork into the Ethereum protocol. 

It‚Äôs no wonder he crossed his arms, spit on the ground, and calmly said: ‚ÄúTell me more.‚Äù

I went on about the promise of DeFi a couple years forward. What are traditionally the margins (profits) of banks will become yours. Some already can be in a limited way for the savvy, but DeFi has way too much friction (this defined as the number of steps required to accomplish something). Consider the genesis of video streaming around 1996 (which is about where we are with Ethereum‚Äôs protocol). Think of the friction there. You needed:

 - to own a 56k modem
 - to download a tcp/icp client
 - to download a media player
 - to find the website
 - to add batch files

The more friction, the higher the learning curve. Fast-forward to today, and everyone carries a dozen video streaming options with them in their pocket, assuming there‚Äôs a smart phone there. Two-year-old children literally know how to use it. DeFi is unusable for the masses right now, this will equally change. 

Yeah my cheap dad. Now I wake up to text messages from him asking: ‚ÄúWhen is moon?‚Äù

Well, probably after Ethereum 2.0, and now that you‚Äôre oiled, I‚Äôd like to explain a concept to look forward to after the upgrades:

**‚ÄîPrivate Charter (ENS-PCT)‚Äî**

Can you picture yourself a resurrection man covered in dirt working a shovel under the white glow of a single moonbeam? Barbaric I know. That was me once. I lost my login information, but luckily had etched my private keys on a metal card before burying it in a forest. Those days weren‚Äôt long ago. Neither were the days of writing shit on paper and stuffing it in a desk drawer. Or the best one I‚Äôve come across which I called the *Victorian:* A fun friend of mine once kept his keys in a very expensive [highly secured] painting. They couldn‚Äôt be gotten to unless the painting was stolen, and scanned with special equipment. He had the painting insured for twice its appraisal value (two insurers aware of the double insurance, but not of the keys, who charged him triple premiums). Then bitcoin broke $10k and it wasn‚Äôt worth it. This *personage* persistently wore that little edge of a smile, hoping it would get jacked. He walked with an exotic wood cane and claimed to be related to Henry James the writer. This isn‚Äôt *Portrait of a Young Lady,* it‚Äôs crypto for chrissakes! Thankfully we‚Äôve graduated to multisig wallets, and currently, social wallets, which Vitalik Buterin wrote a post on recently (link below). 

vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html


I don‚Äôt believe any of that is even close to where we need to get. I propose the ENS-PCT (Ethereum Name Service Private Contract).

ENS-PCT is a smart contract you own. You are the dapp. Money has become like language. You can have as many as you like, but when set up, they are immutable. From it you can do everything a bank does and more: make loans, take loans, equity swaps, sending, spending, leveraging global interest rates (assuming central banks roll out their own stablecoins), help finance a war (kidding kind of), provide liquidity and stake. The latter two are important because ostensibly, they‚Äôll allow you to never have to spend your crypto. If you want to spend, you borrow central bank stablecoins against your collateral. Because this collateral is staked or LP‚Äôd, those rewards offset the borrowed interest rate, probably by a percentage point or more (back to taking those bank margins we talked about earlier). This makes central banks compete in a way they never have before to attract borrowers to their stablecoin. So you can shop around. Also keep in mind your collateral is intrinsically deflationary (assuming it‚Äôs BTC, ETH or something of quality). The legacy financial apparatus (centralized finance) will serve decentralized finance. And they‚Äôll have to do a damn good job of it, one that incentivizes people quite well. I believe they will. If they don‚Äôt, then the coming atomic swap abilities with privacy coins (I‚Äôm especially talking about XMR) will serve as an excellent check and balance that can wreck havoc on taxes among other things.  

The ENS-PCT has a vault and wallet. From the vault, you can recall all funds from your wallet into the vault. After pressing send to send any coins out of the vault, there‚Äôs a countdown unless the transaction is cancelled by email or other secure means. These outbound coins however, can only be sent to say four immutable predetermined addresses, each of escalating security: 

 - a different ENS-PCT vault you set up for yourself
 - an insured centralized exchange (like Coinbase vault)
 - the IRS (US Treasury) who will issue a refund

Any outbound transactions are accompanied by an attached note embedded with your immutable information and instructions. Again, nothing can ever be changed after initial setup. If you don‚Äôt login within a two year period (or however long you choose, or whatever conditions you choose) any borrowing is automatically settled, all funds recalled from the wallet, and all contents sent to the **fourth** predetermined addressee, which we assume is the ENS-PCT vault belonging to your wife, your children, a charity, or the US Treasury, because you‚Äôre dead or incapacitated. Again, detailed instructions embedded. 

Note: With immutable redundancies, private keys slowly start losing their importance

Also consider: The US Treasury should act as the probate, and I believe this is a controversial but elegant solution. 

All activity within the ENS-PCT wallet is protected with an NFT instead of a passcode or keys. You‚Äôll have vowed this NFT to your empty vault before setting everything up in a process called ASM (art secured marriage). This will be used much like Apple‚Äôs finger ID or a decentralized identity where you can choose how much registration or personal info is attached. 

If you‚Äôve gotten this far in this nonsense post of mine, I commend you. We‚Äôre almost finished.

For those talking about crypto cycles, and an eventual crypto winter, I have news for you: those ended when mass adoption got planted late last year. I can only speak of bitcoin and Ethereum (possibly stablecoins and privacy coins), but the global confidence curve of crypto is flattening dramatically. The liquidity here and every longterm metric point to a longterm collapse in volatility. It‚Äôs already happened to bitcoin. I believe the volatility [of bitcoin] will spike after $90k on the way to what is globally seen as a self-fulfilling prophecy of $100k. It likely stays in the $90k-$100k area for many many months as volatility continues edging off permanently. From there expect slow longterm appreciation, where the bank margin capture that we talked about above becomes the new form of speculation starting late 2022.

My prediction for Ethereum is a little different. It‚Äôs still the internet‚Äôs 1996 until 2.0, its major upgrades which I see in January next year. After, it will overtake bitcoin‚Äôs mkt capitalization and begin consuming everything digital, never fully, but think of digital mail (email) and the US Post Office dichotomy. 

People always ask me: ‚ÄúWhat price will you sell your ETH at?‚Äù It‚Äôs a silly question. Never. There‚Äôs no need to. I‚Äôm not a trader, I‚Äôm a DAO citizen. The pre-covid days of bitcoin and Ethereum are gone. The internet is no longer ‚Äú[A] telecom scam sold to people too lazy to visit their local library,‚Äù as a professor once told me. And you‚Äôd be wise to consider that before any fiat interaction, unless you‚Äôre buying land/property or an education.

If I wanted to transfer my Ethereum in my Binance wallet to another wallet (say Coinbase), is the only feasible transfer network ERC20?

NFT Digital Asset Authentication and Storage.,"Hello all.

   Along with buying &amp; staking Ether I want to look for companies which ,(In my 'I barely understand some of this' brain),are looking for a way to authenticate and store assets secured by NFT tokens.  
it seem to me that this will be critical in the next 5-10 years.  
As the ability for the ""average"" consumer to create 'forgeries' of not only digital art, but also actual live footage, there's got to be solutions where we can look at a video and know it's real.  

Think of how much harm is done simply by try picking what people say in speech, etc. now if someone can make a video that is indistinguishable from a real video to the majority of the populace - it'll make facebook social hacking look like Childs play.  


Anyone know of any start-ups or other Companies looking into this?

Question about staking ETH on exchanges,"Hi there,

Fairly new to the crypto scene and have been looking at different exchanges to stake some of my ETH (Binance, Kraken etc) and saw that on Binance you can both stake your ETH for the tokenised BETH at a 1:1 ratio or you can directly trade your ETH for BETH at a ratio of about 0.95:1 at the time of writing. 

My question is would I need to go through the staking page on the website in order to be able to earn the rewards from BETH, or can I also earn rewards on the higher amount of BETH that I could have exchanged my ETH for just by directly trading it on the spot market. 

Just seems like a bit of a loophole so thought I must be missing something!!

The answer is because they can only move the gas limit within a certain range, and they are all voting to keep it as high as possible.

Is that an efficient system? If the cap is going to be artificially low (artificial in this sense meaning the voters ~always vote UP) why even vote in the first place?

Thought experiment.  If the gas limit -limit (the limit of the gas limit) was 100x where it is now, what equilibrium would miners end up creating?",ethereum,1618374491,Bluemandegen,9,1,True,2021-04-13

Train of Thought: Security of ETH," 

In this short post I wanted to write out a train of thought that I had and I'd like to see what people's opinion on this topic were. Anyways it begins:

In the current state of Ethereum, we are transitioning from a proof-of-work model to a proof-of-stake model,  but there is a particular point I'd like to bring up that could end up repeating itself while Ethereum is transitioning to Proof-of-stake.   

An argument that I heard a while back for proof-of-work was that it could be centralized around the mining pools it runs on. These pools could potentially have more than 50% of the  Network's hash power, or a group of them could control the entire network.  Now this argument was quickly discredited by many, saying that miners are not loyal to the pools they mine for.  But what would happen if a majority of the bigger pools all colluded together to make it so that people wouldn't be able to support the other side of the argument. I believe many people would say, ""we don't have enough decentralization"" or ‚Äúwe need more decentralization.‚Äù  Well, we saw a great example of this with the mining pools creating a protest. In this protest, someone listed the pools that we're FOR and AGAINST EIP 1559, and from what I saw, there was only one mining pool that was FOR EIP 1559,  but that single pool had KYC. This in itself shows that even if you are a part of the majority, if you do not OWN a popular mining pool,  you don't have any say in what gets passed on Ethereum.

Now we know that mining secures the blockchain of Ethereum,  but when proof-of-stake replaces proof-of-work,  who are the people that are going to be securing all of Ethereum? It‚Äôs pretty simple; it‚Äôs the validators.  

With the proof-of-stake system, Ethereum developed, the 51% attack vector is now a 67% attack, which in short ‚Äúmakes it harder for attackers to take control of the network.‚Äù  But what happens when people are voluntarily giving their Ethereum to the equivalent of a mining pool (i.e. Centralized Exchanges and Staking as a service Providers). In this case, I can‚Äôt use the same answer that I used for the POW argument. With withdrawals not implemented yet, you can‚Äôt use the same solution that ""Validators are not loyal to the Centralized Exchanges.‚Äù CEXs control the keys and the votes to all of the validators, and people who want to stake ETH have given CEXs this power because someone told them to ‚Äústake on an exchange because it‚Äôs easier.‚Äù If this continues, we‚Äôll be a slightly more decentralized Binance Smart Chain.

With that said, there are many SaaS (Staking as a Service) providers out there, and they claim to be decentralized, but do you even know what it means to be decentralized? You are giving your ETH to a company to stake. Let me repeat that, you are giving ETH to a COMPANY to stake. Is a company decentralized? F\*ck no. Sure the company built the ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù contract, but who runs the nodes and validators? Why do I have to go through trials and be whitelisted to be a validator for YOUR platform? I thought that the ethos of Ethereum was to be as decentralized and permissionless as possible. 

Why is decentralization important? My perception of decentralization is that it include zero possible downtime, a laissez-faire government approach, and legitimacy. My personal reason to support decentralization is fairly simple, in the case if something ever happens to the financial system that I live in, I can choose to opt-out (without anyone getting in trouble), and they won‚Äôt be able to stop me.

In the Ethereum ecosystem I can only really support people who Solo-Stake at this time, because there is no other way to properly decentralize your Ethereum stake. The only other alternative that I see as a solution, to allowing everyone to stake no matter the amount of ETH, is going to be Rocket Pool (when they launch). In short, Rocket Pool is the only truly trustless and decentralized protocol (not a service provider) and I can't think of a reason why it wouldn't do well. 

I'm sure many people reading already had their own ideas or maybe came to your own conclusion. Mine consists of RP being the no-brainer choice, even if you have to wait for it, but let me know what you think.",ethereum,1618377642,lifesmage,7,1,True,2021-04-13

Crypto Wallet - Trezor Model T,"Hey! Apologies if this is the wrong subreddit but the crypto mentioned will be for ETH and perhaps a few others like BTC etc in the future. Apologies in advance if these are pretty dumb questions. We‚Äôre noobs. 

My best friend has been buying crypto and sadly shes so far left it on the exchange as she‚Äôs looking for a hard wallet.

We‚Äôre wondering if it‚Äôs worth an iPhone user to buy the Trezor Model T or the Ledger Nano X? She does not really trust the Ledger due to the addresses etc being leaked and it being a closed source so is leaning towards the Trezor Model T.

She will HODL so she just needs something that‚Äôll keep it safe (we‚Äôre both noobs so I can‚Äôt really advise her).

Is there a problem if the mobile support is for Android-only?

I found a few posts on reddit saying that they had problems using it on their Mac and people suggesting getting a new USB etc. It does make us think it‚Äôll be easier to use the Ledger Nano X? 

Also, just in case the same leaks happen with Trezor, she‚Äôs using her college address (where she stays currently) and not her home address as it will be a different address next year. She‚Äôs using a spam email and was wondering if it‚Äôs best to use paypal to purchase rather than a bank card that states her name etc? Although the problem with paypal is that it has her personal email address and I‚Äôm certain it states the address and name of the person on paypal. She‚Äôll change the address if she can to her college address.

We just want to maximise security even though we know it‚Äôs unlikely someone will show up at her door, but having a list of addresses etc online for anyone to see just makes us feel uneasy.

For anyone that says to search up on google etc and do our own research, she has no WiFi and due to phone issues I can‚Äôt use a lot of my apps including google.

[Rant] Fixed Transaction Fees on MEW --&gt; TX Fails,"I am so frustrated at the moment. I was buying ETH via my Swiss bank (that charge ridiculous 1% fees and 60.- a year for the account). But I had all my ETFs and ETH on that and it seemed convenient at first. But I did some more research and found, that I can do a similar portfolio with Degiro and move my ETH into a MEW.

To do that, I first had to confirm my MEW address by sending a predefined amount of ETH (roughly 0.5$ worth) to the Swiss bank address. The MEW app, however, only allows for three preset fees. Slow, normal and fast (5-8$) and guess what. None of the transactions, I tried all fee settings, came through. I paid 20$ in fees and none arrived and I do not get how this can be. I understand that the fees are high at the moment. But that my tx does not arrive with this pre set fees on MEW is ridiculous -.-

Question about NFT contract types and minting fees,"Hi, I'm putting the question here because it is kind of hard to get a definite answer in the NFT community.   


If you look at the minting prices on a popular NFT market [https://raribleanalytics.com/](https://raribleanalytics.com/)   
you will find that the price of minting ERC-721 is consistently significantly higher than ERC-1155.  
I find this puzzling since - according to my understanding - the properties of ERC-1155 is a superset the ERC-721 , allowing more control over the tokens (selling multiple copies of them). So what explains the higher price. What is the advantage in minting ERC-721?   
The only reason I can think of that ERC-721, being an older type of contract is in some way better supported in the Ethereum ecosystem, is that it? Thanks in advance for elucidating.

"New to Eth, what's the value proposition/differentiator from the other big coin?","Hello, I didn't see a noobie thread or FAQ so please excuse the basic question. I was previously 100% in bitcoin, I recently converted half over to Eth because I hold in BlockFi and they cut interest rates over 1btc so I moved the rest of mine into eth for the 5.25% plus eth seems to have more growth potential.

Anyways, now that I find myself owning quite a lot I wanted to see what the main differentiator and value of eth is. Bitcoin has basically taken hold of the ""store of value"" space as a deflationary hedge, limited supply 21mil decentralized etc, digital gold. But it's not going to be an actual currency due to obvious flaws and transaction times imo, really just view it as a decentralized capped supply digital gold is the selling point.

I know already that eth has much larger supply, and is much more centralized as Vitalik essentially controls it. What's like the simple selling point for eth is it much better equipped to actually become a currency?

Transaction fee exceeding the amount I want to move for what BAT and other random tokens I have are worth,"Okay so I have a bunch of ETH off exchange so the fee wasn't to bad to bite. But for all my tokens that are worth $100 or less the fee is just to expensive to ever move them. Meaning Ethereum is completely unusable. I tried paying $12 even bumped it up to $18 and the tokens will not move. The wallet is estimating I pay a $40 fee to move a token. I also can't seem to find a way to send all tokens at once in the same transaction so I pay the fee once. It seems so stupid that I have to pay the fee more then once and do every token transaction individually, I don't see any way to send multiple at once, which is what I want to do.

I already hate Ethereum at this point. The network scammed me. With bitcoin I just send another transaction and they just take the transaction with a higher fee, and it invalidates the old one like it never happened. With ETH I sent the transaction again as it didn't take it with the lower fee, and now it charged me the fee twice to move the same coins, it took the one with the higher fee to finally move the coins. Right after they took my transaction with the higher fee, they then also took my transaction with the lower fee, which the miners and network failed to move previously before I created the second transaction with a higher fee, but now they decided to all the sudden process the transaction with a lower fee which it look like they never where going to do before. Since the other transaction with a higher fee already went through my balance was zero, the transaction with the lower fee failed as there where no coins left to move, they scammed me as they took this fee and the network did nothing as far as moving my coins.

I also don't understand this Gas Limit vs. Gas Fee. If I up the gas Fee and lower the Gas Limit VS. Lower the Gas fee and Up the Gas limit wouldn't that be the same thing for the total fee in the end?",ethereum,1618423190,BetterIntroduction70,14,1,True,2021-04-14

Impermanent loss XYK Equation,"Hey guys,

I've been trying to grab my head around the XYK formula for impermanent loss, I have attached the referenced example and section that confuses me.

If in this scenario ETH increases to 200USD: how do I use the formula to get the new balance of 7.071 ETH in the pool? I understand that 200\*7.071 must = 1414.21 DAI, but how do I get the 1414.21 DAI?

I feel like there always two unknown variables in the XYK formula...?

Any insight appreciated.

Thanks!

are you aware of any wallet/contract that let's multiple people have access to some funds without having to share the private key s.t. it is still possible to see who executed which transaction. I know there are multisig wallets (e.g. Argent) but from my layman understanding this is usually for security reasons s.t. more than one signature is required for the approval of a transaction. I might be wrong, though.

Ideally it would have some kind of governance that can approve or revoke permissions l but that's a ""nice to have"". For now it's ok, it just everyone has access.

Fundamental thoughts on Bitcoin vs Ethereum: 2 advantages that gold has over silver but Bitcoin doesn't have over Ethereum,"**1.) Better stock-to-flow**

Gold has a better stock-to-flow ratio than silver. The stock-to-flow ratio is the very basic metric to judge if something is a good store-of-value or not, and silver is just worse than gold. This is not the case for Ethereum. It already has a similar stock-to-flow ratio like Bitcoin, but with the upgrade EIP-1559, which burns network fees, Ethereum will be even better than Bitcoin with regard to stock-to-flow.

**2.) Physical advantages**

Gold has physical advantages over silver: 

* It is harder to fake because its density is \~2x higher
* It is more durable because it doesn't tarnish and it is more scratch-resistant
* It is smaller and lighter and therefore easier to store and transport

Bitcoin doesn't have the same advantages over Ethereum. Yes, Bitcoin has proven safety, but this advantage will go away over time, contrary to the physical advantages of gold vs silver, which are here to stay.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:** Don't expect Bitcoin vs Ethereum to play out like gold vs silver. Bitcoin just doesn't have fundamental advantages over Ethereum like gold has over silver.",ethereum,1617963535,MetricSystemYOLO,4,1,True,2021-04-09

"Rant: Thought I was late to the Crypto Game, but realized I am way too early","As my title states, I thought I was too late for the Crypto world. But after my experience with Ethereum realized that Crypto is still in infancy mode.

All I wanted to do was to buy some Altcoin I heard about. I am posting this in r/ethereum as this is what caused most of my expensive pain...although this can relate to most of Crypto

I'm gonna say this now because I know some guy is going to blame this on user error and stick side with the platform. In product development whether software, hardware, or physical product. It is never the user's fault. It is always the products fault. If a user makes an error, it is because the product was designed poorly. If designed well, the user would have never made that mistake.

**Background:** I'm a guy that played with Crypto 3 years ago and got back into it.

1. Wanted to buy some Altcoin and first problem was trying to find the a the proper Exchange that I could trade on (US problems) with the Altcoin.
2. That was Crypto.com and Uniswap
3. Funds Tied up
   1. Gemini because Approved Addresses take a week
   2. Kraken, they don't have ACH. So really have to plan out each Fiat Deposit because of Wire Fee
   3. Crypto.com has Credit/Debit, but nearly all cards reject Crypto stuff. ACH on the way, but that takes forever (Altcoin has already pumped...)
4. So I take whatever Fiat I have in Kraken to buy USDT because I thought it would just be more convenient to see Altcoin to dollar than ETH to Altcoin. Honestly can't make out if I'm profiting if its Crypto to Crypto
5. I got USDT and withdraw to my Hardware wallet through Meta Mask on UniSwap
6. I had some ETH luckily on my Hardware Wallet to Approve on UniSwap, but not enough to Swap. Already paid approval fee... Oh and really high Liquidation Fee. This took forever to get approved. 
7. Had to sell off my DOT on Kraken for ETH. Withdraw that to my Hardware Wallet to fund the UniSwap transaction
8. Unfortunately closed out original approved tab on UniSwap. So now I still have USDT from before because I was stuck on Approval. I noticed before that Uniswap was switching to ETH in between anyways. (USDT &gt; ETH &gt; Altcoin). So I'm like ok I will just switch USDT to ETH this time. Another high Gas fee...
9. Then Switch ETH to my Altcoin. High Gas fee again. Finally!!! done also creating multiple taxable events when I didn't need to.
10. One mistake here and there. $35+ fee each time. My Banks $20 wire fee. Kraken Withdrawal fees. Liquidation Fees. I have lost of $150 on this ordeal. Had lots more problems, but am trying to keep it brief.
11. If I have type in one more Authentication code, I'm gonna lose it.

How to give a gift related to crypto? NFT?," 

Background: Family member gave me a decent amount of $$$ before I went to college last fall, I sent a postcard back but have subsequently made decent sized gains on coinbase and metamask despite having no real knowledge. An NFT looked like an interesting gift, is there a way to send them to someone? Otherwise, could I just hand them them my metamask account with an NFT in it? I've cashed out but it holds a smattering of tokens and evidence of gains as well. They are definitely tech literate and were in the space in the early 10s - i just think it'd be a way to show a kinship - we aren't really close.

let me share my most recent project with you:[ ](https://ethereum.org/static/28214bb68eb5445dcb063a72535bc90c/3bf79/hero.png?Nerolation)

The [ethereum-datahub](https://github.com/Nerolation/ethereum-datafarm) was created to allow anyone to scrape contract data and store it in convenient .csv (and .pickle) format. Using Etherscan's public API the tool loops over each block and extracts the relevant event logs.

No matter if you're an budding data scientist looking to practice on exciting data, a student looking for a topic for his/her thesis or a researcher feeling more used to .csv-format data than to nodes, rpc calls and all the other blockchain stuff - feel free to use my scripts, fork them and give me feedback!

Ethereum data is free from measurement error, missing data or any other pain that data scientists can imagine, but is still rarely used for quantitative research - check it out.

I seriously need help as I‚Äôm in a bit of a crypto hell currently. I‚Äôm an American and I have $164 of a useless currency called USD Digital trapped on a useless (for Americans) website called blockchain.com. They say I need ETH in order to swap my useless USDD to Bitcoin which I need to do in order to send it to cashapp and finally to my bank. 

BUT they won‚Äôt let Americans buy or sell crypto there. Only trade and receive. So they told me I need to send in ETH from somewhere else and assured me that I only need $5 worth to function as ‚Äúgas‚Äù for my purpose. So I made an account on Binance.US and bought $20 of ETH (the minimum allowed) and tried to send it to my wallet on blockchain.com. 

NOPE Binance.US says you need to have at least 0.02 of ETH to do that üôÉ jfc on the cross how can I get my $164 out of that hellsite without spending additional $100‚Äôs?

Do I understand the basics Ethereum? And am I ready to buy in?,"Been diving into crypto this past week and I see a future in crypto I want to be part of. For some reason I started to look into ETH before BTC. Before I buy in for the first time, I want to make sure I understand what I'm buying. So I'll try to explain the basics in my own words, so please, if I say anything wrong, correct me ;).

BTC is a digital currency running on blockchain. Making peer to peer transactions possible without a 3rd party. Ethereum is more like a platform. A platform running on blockchain, making various things possible. Running DApps, applications without a 3rd party. Smart contracts, a contract going into effect when a condition is met, without a 3rd party. NFTs, non fungible tokens which are unique because of certain codes/information (Ethereum has the creater code in the adress + runs a Royalty Tax). You could say BTC is an app, while Ethereum is a Play Store. 

As of now, Ethereum ""lacks"" scalability (transactions per second), security and sustanability. Since running miners takes alot of energy. Ethereum 2.0 is trying to cover that.

Smart contract platforms should become rollups,"Riffing off this excellent post, an absolute must-read for anyone into crypto:  [Will we see a multi-chain world? - The Catalyst (substack.com)](https://dcinvestor.substack.com/p/will-we-see-a-multi-chain-world?r=18im0&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=twitter)

A smart contract blockchain can be broken down into two main components: the virtual machine on which applications are built and the consensus mrchanism. For new platforms, consensus is very challenging, with highly centralized token distributions. Most smart contract platforms have opted for a delegated-type proof-of-stake solution where stakeholders vote for validators - essentially leading to plutocratic cabals over the long term. Needless to say, this has significant decentralization and security compromises. Of course, the delegated-type setups have evolved over the years. For example, Cardano, Cosmos and others improves on EOS/Steem by ""pre-bribing"" voters with ""staking rewards"" - although even in this case, further agreements can be made between validators and stakeholders over and above that. The likes of Polkadot and Tezos improve further by requiring validators to post a minimum number of tokens themselves, and adding slashing mechanisms. Yes, we do have non-dPoS-type chains like Zilliqa and Lukso but they have their own challenges. These consensus mechanisms can be very expensive, typically requiring protocol inflation in the 5%-15% range.

What rollups allow is for smart contract platforms to build their own application layer, while simply contracting Ethereum to do the challenging consensus work. Ethereum brings massive economies of scale into play. The Merge is top priority post London, and soon we'll have Ethereum being secured by proof-of-stake. Unlike many of the delegated-type chains mentioned above, Ethereum uses ""real"" proof-of-stake, where validators are actually proving their own stake instead of others'. Combined with Ethereum's far more decentralized token distribution - thanks to running PoW for 6+ years, a higher market cap/larger economy, and executing significant economic activity on-chain ($20+ billion is settled on Ethereum everyday now!) - this means Ethereum's consensus mechanism can be several orders of magnitude more secure and decentralized than any newly minted chain. After The Merge happens, I expect around 500,000 validators securing Ethereum. (There are 115,000 already.) The overall inflation from proof-of-stake is capped at a maximum 2%, but very likely much lower, not even accounting for EIP-1559 fee burns. Yes, staking pool services and protocols will be built on top of Ethereum too, but they still have to run multiple validators for each 32 ETH stake, each validator still has an equal responsibility, and slashing mechanisms are a strong deterrence. I should note that as mentioned above, some chains do feature aspects of ""real"" proof-of-stake despite delegations - where at least portion of their validation is their own stake and slashing (like Polkadot, Tezos), or randomly selected validators (like Algorand), so there definitely are chains with some hybrid elements. Of course, there's always the possibility that some network comes up with an even better consensus mechanism - we can definitely have another discussion then. 

What rollups can do now is to simply focus on building a world-class application-layer, potentially surpassing what any L1 VM can offer. Currently, we see application-specific rollups like ImmutableX, Loopring, zkSync, dYdX etc. offering massive scalability for specific purposes today. Gas is so low that these platforms are effectively zero gas, fees abstracted away from the end user. ImmutableX does \~9,600 TPS for minting NFTs, and they only have to pay $0.003 in gas to Ethereum L1. That is only $30 for all NFTs in existence today! Sure as hell a lot cheaper than building and paying or your own consensus mechanism. By focusing on the most efficient application layer possible, and contracting out security to Ethereum, they are able to outscale any L1 today, while not materially sacrificing decentralization either. Oh, and transactions are confirmed instantly. Overall, they offer an experience simply not possible on any L1 platform. Of course, we also have generalized rollups incoming shortly, like Optimistic Ethereum or zkEVM, where anyone can deploy smart contracts arbitrarily.

Rollups can also have their own token and economic incentives, their own clients, sequencers and provers etc. I'm just not seeing enough teams leveraging the potential here. Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync 2.0 and StarkNet have a significant headstart, to be sure, but it's not too late to jump into what will likely be crypto's most intensely competitive field in the years to come.

There's plenty of room for innovation on the application layer with more efficient VMs, clients, programming languages, developer tooling etc. while at the same time letting Ethereum do the hard part of a highly decentralized and secure consensus mechanism. For example, zkSync 2.0's ZincVM is based on LLVM, which offers a fantastic alternative to L1 EVM for developers, and enables supporting programming languages like Rust. It's a win-win-win for all: platforms, developers and users. **At this point, building an alternate L1 is more hubris than reason.**

Well, with one exception - when marketing can overpower the security weaknesses, and decentralization is no longer important. Currently, I see only two platforms that have achieved this - Binance Smart Chain and Flow. Both are leveraging very popular centralized platforms - Binance CEX and NBA Top Shots - to build a strong user base and network effects. Or, by building a strong niche - some smart contract platforms may have features not possible with rollups. One such example will be a highly centralized but highly performant chain like Solana which can potentially offer greater throughput than even Ethereum rollups - at least till data sharding releases in the next year or two - but at this level of centralization it's a complete different type of product anyway. 

One last thing - addressing composability and interoperability. Nothing changes here, solutions for L1 &lt;&gt; L1 situation today can be extended to L2 &lt;&gt; L2 and L1 &lt;&gt; L2 communication. Indeed, it could be better than fragmented L1s, for example multiple L2 AMMs can use a common liquidity pool on L1. We have several projects with these type of solutions like Celer, Connext and Hop.

With all that said - which L1 do you think will be the first to pivot to being an ethereum rollup?",ethereum,1617792256,Liberosist,37,1,True,2021-04-07

Lowest Gwei price,"Hi everyone, I am very new to Blockchain and Ethereum and I have a couple of questions and would appreciate it a lot if you guys explain it in a very easy language (plain english, no to very little technical things). One thing I am interested in is lowering a transaction costs (Gwei prices if I understood everything correctly). In my Trust Wallet I can choose the amount of Gwei price and Gas limit. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) What is Gwei price and what is Gas limit? I just know that for a simple transaction like transferring money, the minimum Gas limit is 21,000. Also as you can see in the picture there are different options like ounce and etc. What to they mean and can I adjust them to get the lowest fee possible? 

&amp;#x200B;

2) I have entered the Gwei price as 40 and my transaction got rejected. So what is the minimum Gwei price that I can enter, how do I know it (because if I understood correctly it is constantly changing and there is no fixed price). And also one more very important point for me, I do not neet the transaction to be completed immediately, I can wait for as long as you want, I just want to know how I can get the transaction completed by spending the minimum amount. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would highly appreciate any response. Thanks a lot take care.

Where to start?,"Hi guys,

I am a reasonably long time crypto enthusiast (since early 2017), and have an idea for a DeFi project I would love to have a go at developing.

I‚Äôm not a programmer myself, but am fairly technical and have a background in software implementation and product management. I have a friend that is a developer and coding wizard, however no blockchain experience at all. And a second friend that is a professional marketer but again no blockchain background. 

What are our chances of succeeding without having someone onboard that has deep experience in developing/launching crypto projects? 

I have started on my research journey to find out as much as possible but would like to know if people have any tips to help get us started? Any good literature out there around developing/launching crypto projects, particularly DeFi?

Any advice would be hugely appreciated.

Thanks!",ethereum,1617662343,marcosa89,8,1,True,2021-04-05

My girlfriend is kind of in a tricky situation. Essentially she purchased multiple ethereum a few years ago and kept it in some sort of harddrive wallet (apologies btw if I sound retarded, I dont know much about crypto).

This wallet was saved on her ex's computer. At some point they broke up and he held onto it. (And also stole her turtle like a dick).

Just curious, is there a way she could get this back? I think the total amount could be worth $5000 today.

She doesn't have access to the computer and her ex is a total CHODE.(wouldnt give her turtle back).

She's worried if she contacts him and gives him her pw to get in, that he is going to just ADIOS and ghost her.",ethereum,1617714617,hstabley,31,1,True,2021-04-06

Interesting ERC-20 project in 2021 - A review,[removed],ethereum,1617630845,Which-Wrongdoer7829,0,1,True,2021-04-05
Interesting ERC-20 project in 2021 - A review,"I stumbled across the project StudentCoin. Seems to be the biggest ICO 2021. It reminds me of 2017.


The project is unique in the crypto space and if it starts to get more attention it can become a very popular coin.

Anybody can create their own token on top of StudentCoin via a web interface. No programming skills required.
If you stake StudentCoin (STC) you earn from all transactions of the tokens on top of STC. Students are the future and bring innovation and proper use cases.


In two weeks they just launched their wallet, mobile app and announced 3 exchange listings.


The team confirmed that STC is going to be listed on 9 new exchanges from the top 50 (a few from them are top 20 and top 10) from May 2021.


Their presale is currently live and 109 of 150 phases are finished.


A review is nothing without negative points and criticisms:

¬† - Communication of the team could be improved

¬† - There is a lot of FUD.. The team could just clear this up better and comment on all the criticisms. To improve that they are planning to make a team interview series from next week to be closer to the community.

¬† - The 500 universities are not all real partners.. they just have students from those universities as supporter.. its not clear which universities are partners


The ico price is still really low with 0.018 USD.


A small portion of the circulating supply is beeing traded on Uniswap for 0.026 USD already.


StudentCoin is already on CoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/student-coin/


StudentCoin Twitter: https://mobile.twitter.com/studentcoinorg


There are three options to participate:

¬† - buy STC via Credit Card

¬† - send ETH from your MetaMask wallet

¬† - send any crypto to the Coinbase Commerce payment method


I just found out you can buy the coinbase packages but send more than the package price.. you will receive the correct amount of STC even if you overpay the package.


I recommend using Litecoin due to its low transaction fees.


Coinbase Commerce works also for US investors.


Use this bonus code to get 5% more at the purchase.

My second smart contract! here are my notes...,"# Introduction

In my last post ([LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mhksff/my_first_smart_contract_what_did_i_learn/)) I shared my personal notes about the first experience of programming a smart contract using solidity. Now in this opportunity I'll share the solutions of my ""future tasks"" that I mentioned there:

* How can the parent add more kids to the smart contract? (This question made me laugh after seeing the first comment of that post)
* How can the parent add more balance to the kids

# Smart Contract 

The idea behind this smart contract consist in having a parent that wants his multiple kids to withdraw the money deposited after certain date. You can check the code here: [LINK](https://pastebin.com/Ar0AdNSi)

# Notes:

* We can use mapping(\_key\_type\_=&gt;\_value\_type\_) to link data between different object types. In this case there is a link between a kid address and the amount available to withdraw
* Currently there's not option to check is a key is already in the map but this can be achieve by checking the supposed value 
* In my journey of this development I came across with the ""Smart Contract Security"". I recommend to take a look at this before deploying any smart contract into the real world (I didn't know that smart contracts can be attacked)
* Remember to update internal data before making any external calls. This avoids reentrancy attack 

# Doubts:

* Why paybale(\_address\_).transfer(\_amount\_) does not call the fallback function and msg.sender.call.value(\_amount\_) does?",ethereum,1617638987,bloodkn07,5,1,True,2021-04-05

## The Worst Kind of Centralization

Under this algorithm, changes to protocol code is not determined by miner consensus, but by a vote from staking wallets. Additionally, the protocol weighs votes based on the holdings of staking wallets. So whoever has the most money has the most influence over a vote.

This means that a small group of wealthy stakers can control the entire network, voting on changes that benefit them ‚Äî even at the cost of the rest of the network. Under such a system, a large entity or wealthy group, such as a central bank, can use fiat money to purchase vast quantities of a PoS coin, hold them until their wallets become eligible for staking, and then take over the network.

Once the network has been infiltrated and seized by these interests, they can do things that make the PoS system less efficient and more dangerous than it already is. For example, controlling interests in a PoS network could vote to remove the supply cap. And since they have the highest holdings of staking coins, they get the highest cut of the new coins ‚Äî giving them majority control over the monetary supply.

Such a vote would essentially create a central bank, allowing controlling stakers to use and distribute newly-minted coins as they please. In other words, they can conduct central banking monetary policy.

Consequently, economic cycles, politics, and corruption will enter the equation, throwing the PoS-based economy into chaos.",ethereum,1617641190,Vizion400,48,1,True,2021-04-05

**CryptoSwap is Releasing Its White Paper**

*Keep it here for the release of our Whitepaper, and get to know the master plan and how you can participate!*

In recent years, the use case for decentralized finance has grown. Crowdfunding has made it possible for investors to gain massively simplified access to the funds they need while also reaping the predicted gains. Profits have been made for both those concerned, including the staking group or investors and the pool website.

For many years, participants in the cryptocurrency room have been captivated by this food-based farming craze. We've seen many sites appear in the latest surge of Defi protocols that now enable users to stake their funds in exchange for the protocol's tokens.

Cryptoswap Finance is a decentralized exchange for exchanging BEP-20 tokens that run on Binance Smart Chain and has several other DeFi features that enable you to gain and win tokens. It's quick and inexpensive, and everybody can use it.

The potential of CryptoSwap, the ecosystem, and the features of the Binance Smart Chain are all pointing to greater success for everyone. The transaction speed is very quick and reliable, bringing the required performance, thanks to a flexible network and low transaction fees. Our framework and plan aim to gain universal acceptance and acknowledgment, culminating in the requisite transition and a new level of growth in the cryptocurrency room. 

Let‚Äôs join hands and create something beautiful!

Can I use the ethereum blockchain to organize a raffle for charity?,"Hi. My friends have been raffling objects they made and donating the pooled money to charity. The way it works is people send them USD using venmo or paypal and then whoever set up the raffle donates that money that is being pooled to a charity. The issue is that to donate you have to trust that they won't pocket the money. This trust system limits who are comfortable participating in the raffle, in a sense the raffle can't expand beyond a close network of known people. Would there be a way to set up a crypto wallet that people can send crypto to that can be audited by everyone? It would also be interesting if the wallet would automatically send the money to charity at a set date. In essence, a system that is programmed to pool the money, securely and transparently, and then send it to a charity without needing human input.

The potential resistance to using cryptocurrency for this is that I suspect most people participating in the raffles do not have much crypto experience. There are also transaction fees to consider as well as the issue of potentially having to convert the crypto to USD before donating it. It would be extra cool if the wallet can pick a raffle winner as well! If anybody has any ideas or suggestions I would appreciate it!

What is Layer 2? Confused,"I've been hearing this terminology alot recently. Using a layer 2 solution sounds like its the magical solution to all problems. I'm just confused and have alot of questions about what this even means, if you could help clear any of these things up for me.  


1. Why can you do a ""layer 2""? What does this mean? If something was built as a layer 2 on Ethereum, what are the restrictions for it? Why can't you do the same thing on Bitcoin? 
2. I've heard some people (newbies) say that they should just make a smart contract layer 2 on bitcoin since it's more secure, so that we don't need to use Ethereum. Is this actually possible? I know that bitcoin can't handle smart contracts because it's not turing complete, what about a layer 2 on bitcoin? **Do layer 2 solutions on bitcoin actually remove the purpose of Ethereum?**
3. I noticed that alot of dapps are going to be using layer 2 solutions, to get past the issue with transaction fees currently on Ethereum. **Does this mean the existence of a dapp on layer 2 will not affect ethereum prices at all, and does not benefit ethereum?** For example, if a dapp were on Ethereum, then there would be a large inflow of ethereum buyers increasing the demand for Ethereum. But dapps on layer 2 don't need ethereum tokens, so the users of such an app would not be buying Ethereum tokens.
4. For dapps that do run on Ethereum, after EIP1559 implements gas burning, wouldn't this mean that a ton of eth is going to be burned into nowhere from just dapp usage? This would raise the price of eth.

Does anyone have any insight on comparisons of PoS vs. PoSt? There are seemingly many gains from PoW. Is PoSt a truly better solution for energy consumption? Are there different security trade-offs? Really anything. Thanks!",ethereum,1617548897,thenickb,3,1,True,2021-04-04

Ethereum Scalability Race - April 2021 update,"This is my personal perspective on the current status of scalability on Ethereum. Today, Ethereum is all-in on Layer 2 solutions. While there are different definitions for Layer 2, for the purpose of this post, I define it as solutions secured by Ethereum mainnet. This eliminates sidechains like xDai or Polygon, and focuses on rollups. (I will note that because Polygon checkpoints back to ethereum mainnet, so it's a grey area and still a better solution than any non-ethereum smart contract chain.) For an in-depth explanation of rollups, Vitalik's post is a must-read: [An Incomplete Guide to Rollups (vitalik.ca)](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html)

[DeverseFi](https://twitter.com/deversifi/status/1376537192621862912/photo/1) has a great banner listing some of the Layer 2 projects currently building on Ethereum, I'll cover some highlights from this list.

# Application-specific rollups

Currently, all rollups on mainnet are application-specific. Some of the exciting application-specific rollups are:

\- Loopring: Payments and DEX

\- zkSync: Payments

\- [zk.money](https://zk.money): Privacy payments

\- ImmutableX: NFT minting and exchange. Interestingly, ImmutableX will have multiple applications built on top of it that need to mint and exchange NFTs, such as Gods Unchained and OpenSea.

All of these already do thousands of TPS, many offer gas-free interactions with the very low gas abstracted away from the user. For example, ImmutableX can do \~9,600 TPS, with each NFT mint costing $0.002 in gas, easily subsidized by the protocol as being effectively gas-free to the end user. Another important UX improvement is that transactions are confirmed effectively instantly. Do try these products (and more listed in the banner above) for a glimpse into the future of blockchain scalability.

# Programmable rollups

Not every smart contract has the resources to build their own application-specific rollup. This is where a programmable rollups enters the fray, and where most smart contracts will scale. It's a very interesting paradigm where there's intense competition to build the best execution environment on top of Ethereum. (Which is why I call it ""Scalability Race"".) 

**Optimistic Ethereum**: Limited mainnet since January 2021 (currently Synthetix only for staking), public testnet is now live though not officially supported till later in April. Public mainnet July 2021, although we expect ""whitelisted"" projects like Uniswap, Chainlink, MakerDAO to go live before then.

**Arbitrum**: An optimistic rollup and direct competition to Optimistic Ethereum. They are committed to a fully public release, and are currently on their release candidate public testnet. They have a crucial advantage over Optimistic Ethereum currently, with BLS signature aggregation.

**Fuel**: Also an optimistic rollup. Currently offers payments, but plans to expand into smart contracts later in 2021.

**zkSync 2.0**: Similar to Fuel, currently a payments protocol, expanding into generalized smart contract support. Unlike the above three, zkSync 2.0 is a ZK rollup, which brings the advantage of instant exits to L1. Public testnet: May 2021; public mainnet: July 2021.

**StarkNet**: Direct competitor to zkSync 2.0: a programmable ZK rollup. Scheduled for release in late 2021, though potentially accelerating thanks to an impressive $75 million Series B raise last month.

**Polygon**: Acknowledging the centralization flaws of their current sidechain, Polygon are also developing both ZK and optimistic rollups (among other solutions). No concrete dates I could find. My unsolicited recommendation for Polygon would be to abandon their currently announced kitchen-sink model and laser focus on delivering a world class generalized ZK rollup.

We might end up with a situation here where Ethereum L1 will only act as a settlement and security layer, with a majority of activity happening on rollups. Before we move on beyond rollups, I'd point out that there are multiple projects like Celer, Connext, or Hop that are focusing on interoperability between L1 &lt;&gt; L2 and L2 &lt;&gt; L2.

# Enhancements to application-layer

The application-layer (previously called eth1) protocol, EVM and clients continue to mature. For example, EIP-2929 mitigates DoS attacks and could lead to a minor bump in gas limit. EIP-1559 has strong UX implications that \*might\* mitigate users overpaying for gas, and smooth out spikes. There's no one big upgrade here, but a continuous series of enhancements that'll enable higher gas limits over time. As an example, while I was writing this, Vitalik has published an [intriguing proposal](https://ethresear.ch/t/make-eip-1559-more-like-an-amm-curve/9082) to further improve EIP-1559. For context, many of these improvements have enabled Ethereum's gas limit to increase from 4M in 2017 to 12.5M today. Eventually, we may even get back to eWASM (?).

# Data sharding / data availability sampling (DAS)

DAS is focused on accelerating rollups by offering massive data availability in a granular manner over 64 shards. Where an efficient rollup can do anywhere between 1,000 TPS to 4,500 TPS today, DAS will accelerate this to potentially over 50,000-100,000 TPS. Gas-efficient rollups like ImmutableX will potentially be accelerated past 200,000 TPS. Previously, this was set to ship before The Merge, but is now coming after The Merge, potentially later in 2022 or early 2023. By the way, The Merge itself does not lead to scalability upgrades, but we could see related [proposals to increase gas limit](https://ethresear.ch/t/commit-to-pre-state-instead-of-post-state-on-the-executable-beacon-chain/8802) after The Merge.

# Statlessness / state expiry

Incredibly, we have gotten this far without actually increasing L1 scalability significantly. L1 gas is going to remain high for the near future - get used to it. This may not matter too much if we have massive scalability on L2, though, as that's where most users will be. L1 will act more of a settlement layer for the bigger players - rollups, exchanges, financial institutions, whales etc.

However, with statelessness / state expiry, this is finally being addressed - L1 gas limits will see significant increases without materially sacrificing decentralization &amp; security. It's still early days, but we finally have some [concrete options available](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/state_expiry_paths). We don't have a date here, but personally I wouldn't expect this before 2023.

# Executable sharding

What was previously Phase 2 has now been pushed back given the better solutions now available. Pretty crazy to think rollups did not even exist when sharding was first conceived as a scalability solution! This is where the shards no longer just offering data availability for rollups, but are also able to execute transactions themselves. It's hard to imagine how this will turn out - if rollups attain critical mass and statelessness allows for a significant enough gas limit uptick, we may not even require executable shards at all and it would be better to focus on enhancing (or increasing) data shards, for example. Or, it could be that we only require a smaller number of executable shards. Definitely the most nebulous step here, and something that'll only become clear over time.

# Hybrid scalability

I definitely believe that we'll see all kinds of hybrid solutions going forward, with various degrees of decentralization over multiple layer. Visa and [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) are effectively acting as scalability sidechains for Ethereum, though with a significant degree of centralization. What we might see in the future is that Visa cuts out [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) and goes directly to a rollup/L2 wallet/service provider. Likewise, I can also see Reddit build their own rollup, which keeps a lot of data on their centralized servers, and only settles the important stuff on mainnet. We already have such solutions today: for example DeverseFi uses Validium where less critical data like order books (?) are maintained on centralized servers, while all transactions and balances are on-chain. It could even apply for a [mainstream application like Fortnite](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/midbun/daily_general_discussion_april_2_2021/gt4e4a6).

Will pay 10% to anyone who can help me get back my lost Eth.,"Here's how it went down:

1. Moved some ETH onto my MetaMask Wallet
2. Went to [uniswap.org](https://uniswap.org/)
3. Located token I wanted to buy on CoinGecko (CGG)
4. Added CGG to my Metamask wallet
5. Hit the 'max' button on [uniswap.org](https://uniswap.org/) to buy CGG, hit confirm swap
6. I get 'waiting for confirmation' and look over at my metamask
7. MetaMask notification: ALERT: Insufficient funds. The 'confirm' button is of course greyed out.
8. Rather than hitting 'reject' on metamask, I just hit the x on the 'waiting for confirmation' page on Uniswap.
9. I repeat this several times trying to purchase CGG.

Now I have no CGG in my Metamask Wallet, and my ETH has gone from 2 to 0.7.

Have I lost my ETH permanently?

[https://etherscan.io/address/0xED7C58b496AaE2C6a9753E08d90D7bC75C28f16b](https://etherscan.io/address/0xED7C58b496AaE2C6a9753E08d90D7bC75C28f16b)

It's the transaction for about 1.2 ETH.

I don't remember pressing confirm, but I didn't hit 'reject' either. Every time i hit swap, metamask just kept telling me i had insufficient funds. but rather than hit reject on metamask, i went back to the uniswap page and hit the x and tried to swap again. each time I would enter a slightly smaller amount of ETH, hoping the transaction would go through, because I know I had 2eth, and I knew the gas fees were around $40.

Not sure what happened, but it looks like at some point I confirmed and in a single transaction 1.2 eth left my metamask wallet. To whom it went and how it happened without me receiving any CGG, stumps me.

p.s. another strange thing is that, on my metamask wallet, under the 'activity' tab, there is no recording of the eth leaving my wallet on march 23rd, as there is on the etherscan.io link i sent it. the two don't tally. the last entry on the 'activity' in metamask tab is 1.992 eth entering the wallet on the 19th of March, (this transaction is also visible on etherscan.io link I sent you, of course). What do you make of this discrepancy? Why is this info absent from metamask but not from etherscan.io?

one last point. as you can see from the etherscan.io link i sent, I had moved some eth on and off of the metamask wallet (around 30th January - 8th February) while I was toying with the idea of buying on a defi exchange like uniswap. I finally decided to take the ETH off the metamask wallet. when i did, the transaction was for almost the exact same amount that I ended up losing this time around (on Feb 8th). I mention this because from the time I emptied the metamask wallet on Feb 8th, until march 23rd when i lost my eth, there was a strange message in the metamask wallet activity tab. it was like a 'pending' message, i can't remember exactly. i just wondered if there was any connection between this transaction and my more recent loss of eth, simply because the amounts are so similar.",ethereum,1617557871,Responsible-Public25,22,1,True,2021-04-04
Minted my first NFT on rarible!,"Some feedback would definitely be appreciated on it, will link it below in the comments.  

But just thought I'd make a post about the process for anyone who might be interested in it. It was really easy tbh, once you've got your artwork you just start up a wallet (pretty sure most of you will have this already) - I used metamask to link my Rarible account to, though primarily I use exodus. Then you can just make an account, and then you start to create your NFT by putting in the details and uploading the assets and stuff, there are 2 fees when you create your first one. I think the first fee was like a verification thing basically? The second fee is to mint your NFT, which is basically tokenising your art into a specified amount of tokens that people can then purchase etc. Once you've gone through all this, you should have your NFT on your profile and everyone else will be able to see it too. It does seem like unless you're verified you kinda go a bit unnoticed, but the community is nice, especially on discord.

I thought it would be a lot more complicated than it was, although gas fees are mad expensive right now I'm glad I've done it now and been a part of it, and look forward to putting more improved stuff up as NFT's :D",ethereum,1617558047,r3d3mpshun,9,1,True,2021-04-04

NFT SALES VOLUME BEGINS TO PLUMMET ü§îüëÄüßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,"* Only weeks ago, it seemed impossible for the digital art market to cool off. Throughout February, the non-fungible token (NFT) craze was in full spotlight, with the mania reaching its peak with the record setting $69 million Beeple auction. At its height, even Tesla‚Äôs CEO Elon Musk tweeted about selling his NFT.
* But as the novelty began to wear off and speculators moved on, the NFT market has been in a continuous downtrend. Sales figures across online marketplaces for digital art and collectibles have dropped precipitously, potentially exposing the absence of organic demand in the NFT space.
* According to figures from Nonfungible, the average daily value of NFTs sold across marketplaces fell from $19 million to $3 million on March 25th ‚Äî approximately an 85% decrease. Other major metrics have flashed worrying signs.
* In the past week alone, the gross number of sales and unique buyers declined by 30% and 35, respectively. These figures have left speculators and market participants questioning whether the NFT space is experiencing a temporary pullback, or if its hype was merely a flash in the pan.
* NBA Top Shot, an NFT marketplace for NBA trading cards, has seen the total value of NFTs in circulation (represented by total market capitalization) shed $800 million ‚Äî dropping from a high of $1.85 billion to $1 billion. According to evaluate.market, the total value of sales suffered a similar decline, as demand waned on the secondary market.
* What‚Äôs interesting, however, is that demand is still relatively healthy in the primary market. New releases from Top Shot continue to sell out almost instantly. Considering this, it‚Äôs likely that the speculative frenzy for NFTs had overheated the market ‚Äî leading the space to only experience a temporary pullback.

Interesting project in 2021 - A review,"I stumbled across the project StudentCoin. Seems to be the biggest ICO 2021. It reminds me of 2017.


The project is unique in the crypto space and if it starts to get more attention it can become a very popular coin.


In two weeks they just launched their wallet, mobile app and announced 3 exchange listings.


The team confirmed that STC is going to be listed on 9 new exchanges from the top 50 (a few from them are top 20 and top 10) from May 2021.


Their presale is currently live and 106 of 150 phases are finished.


A review is nothing without negative points and criticisms:

¬† - Communication of the team could be improved

¬† - There is a lot of FUD.. The team could just clear this up better and comment on all the criticisms. To improve that they are planning to make a team interview series from next week to be closer to the community.

¬† - The 500 universities are not all real partners.. they just have students from those universities as supporter.. its not clear which universities are partners


The ico price is still really low with 0.017 USD.


A small portion of the circulating supply is beeing traded on Uniswap for 0.026 USD already.


StudentCoin is already on CoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/student-coin/


StudentCoin Twitter: https://mobile.twitter.com/studentcoinorg


There are three options to participate:

¬† - buy STC via Credit Card

¬† - send ETH from your MetaMask wallet

¬† - send any crypto to the Coinbase Commerce payment method


I just found out you can buy the coinbase packages but send more than the package price.. you will receive the correct amount of STC even if you overpay the package.


I recommend using Litecoin due to its low transaction fees.


Coinbase Commerce works also for US investors.


Use this bonus code to get 5% more at the purchase.

Risks of signing?,"So I feel I do more and more signing with L2 and OpenSea and other services where you are not directly transacting. I'd like to understand the risks involved. 

I think I've understood there to be a risk of signing something that is a cleverly composed transaction, allowing the attacker to steal funds. Is this correct? How do you identify it?

I've at least seen these types of signing:
* what appears to be base64

We're unlocking the true power of NFTs. Influence is a space strategy MMO incorporating Parallel's NFT game assets into our game.,"Within the NFT space right now, you can find almost an infinite number of artists creating amazing works and selling them as NFTs. This is an exciting new space currently being explored, but what are the true powers of NFTs?

NFTs are a hot new buzzword, everyone has heard it by now, but most (even in the crypto space) are still wrapping their heads around what they are and how they can be utilized. Not to say that selling art as an NFT is a bad thing, but NFTs are vastly more powerful than this, and the depth in which they can be utilized is just beginning to be showcased.

I work for an Ethereum blockchain gaming company, releasing the title [Influence,](https://www.influenceth.io/) where in-game assets are composed of NFTs. This gives players actual unique ownership over the content they acquire while playing Influence. We think that this adds a layer of depth on top of the existing utilization most know. However, even this is just the beginning!

NFTs, once minted on the blockchain, can be tracked, and utilized by anyone, while the owner still maintains custody and rights to it. This opens doors to platforms like Influence to support other game assets within their game.

We announced earlier this week that we would be incorporating another game‚Äôs assets into our game. Parallel is a card game that just released their Alpha set of cards, and we loved how well their content would work in our game. So we reached out to the team and asked if they would be okay if we utilized some of their NFTs as pieces to our game. I should mention this does not take permission and is another benefit of the Ethereum blockchain, but we wanted to ensure a solid relationship with the incredible Parallel team.

So maybe you are asking yourself, ‚Äúso what if you are utilizing another game‚Äôs content in your game, what does that mean for me?‚Äù

Great question! It means that the content you either acquire or purchase within one game can now cross over into other games. Imagine playing EVE Online or World of Warcraft and collecting every piece of gear possible, and you want to stop playing these games and try something new. With the cross-functionality of assets being supported in multiple games, it opens up the ability to immediately utilize what you earned in one game into the new game.

This creates an entire ecosystem that supports each other, and instead of game companies trying to steal players into their game, they can help promote each other and ensure the content is what players want. It is a symbiotic relationship that over time will benefit all parties involved, especially the players.

Dracula Protocol V2: Defi‚Äôs yield aggregator that drains defi?,"

**Yield Farming**   


We‚Äôve probably all heard of the phenomenon that is ‚Äòyield farming‚Äô by now. In short, this is a process during which users temporarily lock up some of their assets in order to recieve rewards or interest. This can include liquidity mining, staking, lending, minting and anything in between. 

Basically, anything that lets you ‚Äòharvest‚Äô additional yields on your assets (next to a potential price increase of the underlying asset). These rewards come in different forms, such as in the very same asset that was originally deposited, or in a totally different one. Or in multiple different assets, even. These assets can then be put to work again, in order to accrue additional rewards, which can be put to work again. And so forth. Yield farmers can participate actively in multiple yield farming strategies on different protocols or blockchains at the same time, too.  


https://preview.redd.it/baohprasuoq61.png?width=566&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a809c902db6adae5b94eee088c24c4b0428257a

Image taken from Defipulse Yield farming has been there since the very beginning of the DeFi boom during the summer of 2020. Arguably, it was the meteoric rise of yield farming options as well as the DEX that formed the moat of this boom. Since then, DeFi has been on an unstoppable run and an ever increasing amount of money is being circulated (and generated). Today, there is hardly a DeFi protocol that doesn‚Äôt incorporate at least some form of yield farming and it has become an unmistakable pillar within the world of crypto. As you might expect, participating actively can quickly turn into a highly complex operation. And an expensive one too, as each seperate transaction requires more gas, or fees, to be paid by the user. This is explains, in part, why yields can often be so attractive; Actively farming is labor-intensive, expensive and complicated. But that‚Äôs about to change.

**Dracula Protocol V2**   


https://preview.redd.it/va6msqoouoq61.png?width=1109&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=252737acbafa946d191f6af56860e5734be3d328

**Full automization**   


Dracula Protocol V2 fully automates these complex and expensive processes, and makes it as easy as clicking a button for anyone to earn the highest yields possible on their assets. With some cool extras. But perhaps more importantly, Dracula also eliminates the gas fee problem alltogether, further adding to its‚Äô user returns. To achieve this, the Dracula team has built out a protocol-agnostic platform that is able to connect with any protocol and collect rewards autonomously. It then takes these rewards (and more) to boost returns for its own users. It takes all the hard work out of yield farming under a single web interface. Which is great, but there‚Äôs more.

**Gas elimination**   


Gas fees are another major issue, often forcing regular users out of lucrative opportunities. Dracula Protocol drastically reduces fees so that regular users are priced out no more, and turns the money saved into additional yield. It achieves this by cleverly pooling user funds together. This way, Dracula only requires a single smart contract interaction to act on the behalf of an entire pool, versus thousands of individual interactions required otherwise. This single transaction fee is then spread out over the entire pool, resulting in an extremely low fee per user.  


 All this capital saved is then distributed back to users in the form of additional yield. Whale power Whales dominate the markets through sheer firepower. In yield farming, that is no different. Each whale owns a large piece of a specific pie, and gets to take home the best returns while excercising control over the market. They leave individual holders vulnerable, who risk being dumped on while chasing lower returns. Dracula Protocol was originally designed to combat exactly this. To fight a whale, one must become a whale.   


A third major benefit to Draculas‚Äô pooled farming is its ‚Äòwhale power‚Äô. Every market Dracula enters, it enters with the combined firepower of thousands of individuals. This allows Dracula itself to act like a whale entity on behalf of its users and claim a significantly larger piece of the pie, bringing home even better returns. It levels the playing field and is able to fight other whales on their own terms. With the added comfort of full automization and significant gas savings. But it gets even better.  


https://preview.redd.it/2x616p4vuoq61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a80231b9b90526591ca0c90e566f29ff881eb70

**Profit compounding** 

As explained earlier, one temporarily lock up his/her funds in order to accrue rewards. The longer the lock-up, the more rewards to be claimed. To maximize returns during this period, however, one would ideally claim rewards and re-stake regularly. This allows one to continue farming with a larger stack, which accrues more rewards and so forth.   


This is known as ‚Äòcompounding‚Äô. But compounding is labor-intensive and expensive, with each transaction setting you back additional gas fees. Often times, this is only worth the effort (and money) after an extended period of time and significant rewards. This is sub-optimal as no compounding takes place in between, making you miss out on additional gains. Dracula fixes this through its extremely low gas fee structure and automization capabilities. This allows Dracula to collect and compound rewards on a daily basis autonomously, while only having to pay for a fraction of the gas fees. Additional yield booster As if a single web interface, full automation, higher returns, massive gas savings and auto-compounding isn‚Äôt enough, there is one last trick up Draculas‚Äô sleeve.   


Dracula built a second, interest-earning layer on top of the automized yield aggregation process. Partner Rari Capital is integrated to achieve this. This is designed to function as an additional yield booster, actively earning users interest on top of their growing capital. It automatically switches between the most efficient interest-earning strategies available, itself always ensuring the highest additional returns as well. Mind you this profit on top of profit is being auto-compounded on a daily basis, only further adding up for its users.

Dracula Protocol V2 is set to launch early April 2021 ETH and DRC $ETH So what if you‚Äôve turned enough profit and you‚Äôd like to cash in? Normally, you‚Äôd be left holding multiple types of tokens you‚Äôd have to have to sell individually. Another labor-intensive, expensive task. But not with Dracula. Dracula is unique in that it ‚Äòs able to convert everything for you, and allows you to withdraw your profits into a single token, namely $ETH or $DRC (stablecoins might be next). This eliminates another burdensome part of yield farming and offers you direct exposure back into DeFi‚Äôs native currency, without having to do anything. But there‚Äôs another option.

$DRC $DRC is the native currency of Dracula Protocol (Not to be confused with ‚ÄòDigital Reserve Currency‚Äô). When a user opts to be paid in $DRC, something interesting happens. This $DRC doesn‚Äôt come from minting and releasing extra tokens, like so many protocols do today. Adding to a (hyper) inflationary token design. All $DRC has already been minted and is out on the open markets. And its supply is capped, meaning no extra $DRC can ever be released. Instead, every time a user collects profits, the underlying rewards from connected protocols are sold, and $DRC is bought up straight from the open markets. 

This adds selling pressure to ‚Äòvictim‚Äô tokens and buying pressure to the $DRC token. If you think about it, Dracula is a protocol that‚Äôs able to ‚Äòdrain‚Äô value from other protocols in order to ‚Äòfeed‚Äô its own. Get the name yet? This could potentially lead to strong, constant market buying applied to a capped, non-inflationary token. Community members sometimes refer to $DRC as a ‚Äòself-pumping‚Äô token. Because it kind of is. Imagine the daily buying pressure arising from a potential $200,000,000 Total Value Locked, earning compounding rewards for its users daily, of which 50% choose to receive their rewards in $DRC. This excludes speculative buying, which still makes up the majority of volume today. Taking into account $DRC‚Äôs current $12 milion market capitalization, that might not be a bad proposition.

Fully diluted market cap and its implications: re-ranking the TOP 100 coins," **Not taking the ""Fully Diluted Market Cap"" metric into account seriously will cost a lot of new enthusiastic crypto investors money and desperation.**

The main difference to the market cap (*actual supply times price*) is that a fully diluted market cap takes into account the *maximum possible supply times price*, i.e., also the coins that are not mined or minted yet. Many projects have really a fraction of the total supply in the circulation, which makes their price and market cap appealing as a good investment.

To see how big a difference the diluted market cap creates in practice, I have analyzed the top 100 coins by their market cap (to date 2. 4. 2021). From all the top 100 CMC coins **I am reporting such coins whose circulation currently makes less than 75 % of the total supply.** For these coins, I show the relative *ratio* between market cap and fully diluted market cap, and also the *adjusted rank* that supposes all the coins went immediately into circulation at the current price. The coins are ranked from the ones that have the smallest ratio of coins in circulation.

I am wondering which are the best programs to mine with? How to calculate the electricity usage. Also will I be using more actual electricity than I already use since the PC's are active for gaming? I am made some calculations and I am aiming to mine Ethereum, any other suggestions?   
I need help in calculating the income of each PC, and whatever tips/advices that are possible, thank you in advance!

ASIC miners + 1559 + quick PoS... Potential problem?,"Disclaimer: I'm just a guy who mines with my 3080 on my computer that I bought for gaming/school. Using the cash to help me pay off my college tuition. I don't really care about mining profits reducing because once it isn't profitable anymore I'll just continue to use my computer as I always have. 

So I've been a little bit concerned with the changes that will happen to Ethereum in the next year. I think that they are all a step in the right direction, but due to them all occuring so close to eachother I believe this could have the potential for disaster. Here's why: 

* **ASIC miners coming online**: this isn't a problem on its own, but just keep this in mind for now. Some of the most efficient ASICs Eth has ever seen are coming online and are increasing network difficulty significantly. These are centralized mostly in China (see: Bitcoin), and estimates state they could currently represent anywhere from 10-40% of current network hashrate. 

* **EIP 1559**: Again, I think this is a great idea and a needed UX change for ETH. However, with ASICs coming online and increased difficulty, I fear this will kick many GPU miners off of the network. This is because ASIC miners cannot switch off the network, and they are also very power efficient and pay very little for power.  Personally I think that by August/September, GPU mining will not be profitable anymore. 

* **PoS merge**: this could happen as early as October from what I have heard. Again, I think this is a great and necessary change. However, I believe that there is very high chance that by October, ASIC miners will comprise 60%+ of the network hashrate based on these two reasons alone. **I do not think they will take the merge with open arms**. You are talking about people who invested hundreds of thousands of dollars on massive ASIC farms that will be left useless after the merge to PoS. They have no resell value and cannot be used to mine anything else. By the time the merge occurs, they might not have made back their initial investment, and will be hoping to secure their profits at all costs. I think a 51% attack from ASIC miners is very likely to occur by the time of the merge. 

If Eth shoots up to like double or more of what it is today, GPU miners will stay on and this is less likely to happen, but I wouldn't count on it. There are very simple things we can do to avoid this but it needs to be done sooner rather than later. I'm not asking for a delayed merge or to stop EIP-1559. I want both of those to happen. I'm asking that the community considers an implementation of ASIC resistance to help prevent an attack on the network. 

I'm open to any discussion and counterargument. These are just my thoughts.",ethereum,1617234081,excitius,7,1,True,2021-03-31
"‚ÄúPatsy attacks‚Äù, a possible IRL exploit against blockchain tech","Hypothetically: would it be possible for malicious actors to enter data into the ethereum blockchain (or another blockchain) with the intention inciting hostile action against the blockchain by government actors?

Let‚Äôs say that a bad actor input data into the blockchain that, when unzipped by a highly popular and available compression software, was converted into something illegal (use your imagination)

In this scenario, the illegal data would be publicly visible on the blockchain and it would be impossible to remove without destroying the blockchain itself, if such a thing is possible. The unzipping software could not be made illegal, and there would be no way to ‚Äúblack out‚Äù or even obscure the compressed data on the blockchain. This would incite law enforcement and regulators to attack the blockchain, like some kind of maliciously incited autoimmune disease.

I thought that the term ‚Äúpatsy attack‚Äù was an interesting label (if there isn‚Äôt one already) because it basically allows hostile entities to weaponize the police as a weapon. 

So is such a thing possible? If not on the ethereum network, is this something that other blockchains might need to fear in the future?",ethereum,1617235849,xPangloss,13,1,True,2021-03-31

ERC20 / DEX / Fee's - Question,"Hi

I have 3 different ERC20 tokens in my Wallet and i wanted to send them to an exchange but every transaction fee would be \~12$.  

So i would have to pay 36$ fee for sending them to exchange.

I thought maybe swaping them on a DEX (uniswap, kyber,. ...) to ETH and then send the ETH to an exchange could safe me money.

&amp;#x200B;

i loged into a Dex and wanted to swap ERC20 tokens into ETH but i always get the message "" Your ETH balance is not enough to pay for the transaction fees ""

but i have 150$  worth of ETH on that address.  Does it mean to swap  ERC20 tokens to ETH on a DEX does cost more 150$ ???

"Opinion: Time to sunset the ""Ethereum 2.0"" branding (and just call then ""Ethereum upgrades""?)","I'm sure we've all heard ""Ethereum 2.0 / ETH2.0 is years away"", ""ETH 2.0 is Ethereum's last shot at lowering gas fees"", ""Competitors are delivering ETH2.0 features today"", ""Eth 2.0 is the next version of Ethereum"", ""Ethereum 2.0 is a new chain that will replace the current chain and lead to massive headaches for developers and users"", so on and so forth. Of course, none of this is true, but understandable given the misleading Ethereum 2.0 branding. Danny Ryan has spoken about this vocally, and we've seen EF researchers start calling what was eth1 and eth2 application-layer and consensus-layer respectively. While this is an elegant and accurate nomenclature for developers, researchers and enthusiasts, it's still confusing to the average user and investor. 

Now, I don't quite grasp the black magic that is marketing, so perhaps some of you will have a better suggestion. What we want to do is shift the narrative and just consider all of it one Ethereum, with no ""next version"". Instead, we have an incremental set of upgrades that are rolling out regularly in the next 2-3 years. 

Arguably, the significant upgrades coming in the foreseeable future to Ethereum are rollups, EIP-1559, The Merge, data sharding, and statelessness; with several minor upgrades. As an example, even a ""minor"" application-layer upgrade like EIP-2929 will potentially enable a small bump in the gas limit, and thus have a greater direct impact on L1 gas than the major big upcoming consensus-layer upgrades - proof-of-stake and data sharding.

Philosophical Question: Abundance of Blockchains and Tokens,"We‚Äôre at the point where there are so many blockchains and tokens with variety of protocols.

ADA, DOT, AVAX, etc will have different protocols and ecosystems. In order to truly foster innovation and adaption, there needs to be single layer that allows tokens to move freely across platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello Reddit!

First time posting here!

I wanted to share a creation I thought people in this subreddit might be interested in.

A buddy and I recently stepped into the Crpyto world and both purchased Ledger Nano X's. After finally getting all of our crypto transferred over we were faced with

the task of finding a place for our secret pass phrases.

As we both talked about getting those steel metal wallets and the idea came up to engrave the words into wood with my buddies 

laser engraver. This seemed like a fairly reasonable project. Due to it being wood we of course got  steel ones as well in case of a fire because

you know..wood and all. Added a hanger to hang it on the wall with the passphrase numbers up against the wall and the Doge logo, QR code, and wallet address facing out

for quick scans if needed which works flawlessly by the way.

I just wanted to share the project with anyone who may be interested in doing the same.

I found this app that was able to convert the words to numbers and encrypt it with Bip39 so I felt comfortable sharing since the actual words aren‚Äôt there.

If you have any questions on the process I would be more than happy to answer them to the best of my abilities!

Have a great day!

Is the concept of STORJ ethical?,"Hear me out. I am trying to maintain an open mind and observe different thought processes when I make my decision. I am considering buying STORJ, but I have a lot of questions on how ethical it is. 

If I understand it correctly, this project on the Ethereum chain allows for decentralized cloud storage. Of course, this means that no one can monitor the type of content/information that gets stored on STORJ. This is obviously good because my information isn't Google's or Apple's- it's decentralized. I like that because they cannot use that information to make **me** their product (through selling that information to other companies). 

However, this cloud storage being decentralize could also theoretically mean that these nodes have God knows what sort of data. All the illegal stuff possible. Of course, the same thing was said about BTC back in the day, and I understand that. But there is, at least in my mind, a difference in ethics between the **currency** *used* to pay a terrorist and potentially **storing literal data involved in a terrorist plot**. 

Perhaps a Star Wars illustration: I wouldn't feel bad if I ended up with the same Credit that  came from the profits from making the Death Star, but literally storing the plans to the Death Star on my computer (without even knowing it) is potentially another question, ethically speaking,

Why is a DAG memory hard?,"I'm wondering what specifically about a directed acyclic graph is more memory hard than say, a deterministic large pool?  As I understand it, ASIC resistance is achieved by creating lots of large memory access, thereby reducing the value of compute only modules and forcing multi-die ASIC solutions which will be less $/mhz bandwidth efficient.

So what if, instead of the DAG, I take the prior block hash, run it through a series of general purpose operations (add/div/mult/xor/etc) and then make a huge pool of these numbers based on that.  I create 4GB of numeric garbage instead of a DAG.  Then the hashing algo takes the nonce (in the header) and mixes in N rounds of chunks (say 256 bytes) of data taken from this big garbage dump of data to make the final hash for difficulty compare.  Every full node can calc it because its deterministic (based on prior block hash) and there's no easy way to pre-calc it; you have to have high memory bandwidth.  If the garbage builder takes too long then set it on an epoch (rebuild every N blocks).

Just wondering what is special about the DAG vs some other assembled block of data.",ethereum,1617057266,FurrieBunnie,0,1,True,2021-03-29

Noob gets rekt by ETH gas fees,"So lately like most people I‚Äôve been hearing a shit ton about NFTs. Being the curious soul that I am I decided to check them out. After doing some research I figured it was something worth my time. Being somewhat of an artist myself (Totally kidding btw), I thought it would be fun to make some, so I did. 

Now fast forward a few days to when it‚Äôs time to mint my Picasso esque MS Paint drawings. I go to mint them and it says 15 dollars, in my head I‚Äôm like ‚Äúok this started off as a joke, but now it‚Äôs a $15 dollar joke, pretty expensive joke but fuck it.‚Äù After paying the $15 to get it approved by Rarible, I was encountered by another fee, this time a fee for minting my tokens. 

Oh no no no PepeLaugh (iykyk)

50 fucking $$$$!!! Being the broke college student that I am, I was like no shot I‚Äôm paying this. So I decided to be a smarty pants and put a custom gas fee. I made it the lowest gas fee possible, $15. Now my $15 joke is a $30 joke and I‚Äôm not finding it as funny anymore. But the story doesn‚Äôt end there. 

PepeLaugh

Fast forward like a week later, the transaction still hasn‚Äôt gone through. At this point I‚Äôm gassed (pun intended), I say screw it, I‚Äôll pay the $50 just to get this over with. And that‚Äôs what I did, but guess what, I chose to speed up the transaction that had already failed. I SPENT $50 on an already failed transaction. Instead of being a cheap fuck, I should‚Äôve paid the first time instead of messing it up on the second.

Incentive misalignment in staking,"Staking aligns the security needs of the Ethereum network with its minimum necessary issuance monetary policy, while trying to be fair to ETH owners. However, I think this alignment will be imperfect once withdrawals are enabled.

At the moment, the effective balance has an upper limit of 32 ETH. This was good to begin with, to prevent a small number of over-sized validators running the show. However, this prevents compounding of staked ETH over time. By itself this would be OK, but there is a way around that. For example, if withdraws are approved now, and staker having 32 validators with 33 ETH each can exit and re-enter with 33 validators of 32 ETH, increasing his returns.

This is a problem for two reasons:

1. It creates unnecessary friction, with big players constantly rotating their validators\*. It may also affect security, although it seems minor to me.
2. It gives an unfair advantage to large players, that can start compounding quickly, while single validator owners will have to wait until they accumulate 64 ETH.

The simple solution is to increase the max effective balance, for example to 320 ETH. This will solve the problem completely. It may also reduce the number of validators, but without affecting the staked amount. This may be good, making the network more efficient (there is no real reason for me to run several validators on the same computer) and maybe even allowing to reduce the 32 ETH limit.

\*The optimal rotation time depends on the number of validators and length of exiting and re-entering.

Why investment in Ethereum is good?," Let me know your opinions.

## 1. Ethereum could be a world PC

Take, for instance, resources: homes, craftsmanship, extravagance vehicles, and so forth Ethereum‚Äôs savvy agreements can get responsibility for things. Unfamiliar financial backers and individuals all throughout the planet will not have to go through the organization of outside countries framework to claim a home or fine art in another country. They can utilize a shrewd agreement based on Ethereum. Furthermore, they can pay with Ethereum as well.

The world might be interconnected because of the web, yet Ethereum is showing better than ever levels of interconnection for organizations and private people all throughout the planet.

In light of this, the response to the inquiry ‚Äòis Ethereum a wise venture‚Äô begins to resemble an easy decision.

## 2. Ethereum will give us Tokenization

The World Economic Forum (WEF), in their overviews and examination, extended that ‚Äúup to 10% of the worldwide Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will be put away and executed with the assistance of blockchain innovation by 2025‚Äì27.‚Äù

ethereum tokenization

Remember what they are saying: every country worldwide will utilize blockchain innovation up to 10% of its GDP.

A couple of years prior, as I was puzzling over whether I ought to put resources into Ethereum, the idea of tokenization and all its utilization cases for Ethereum made my brain clear like water: Ethereum is the future, and there are bunch reasons why Ethereum is important.

[Pro strategies to make profits from crypto coins](http://mg07.qlitrk.com/l/freecryptoclass)

 

## 3. Ethereum can run uncensorable applications

Control is a main problem in the advanced world.

Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, these organizations maintain all authority to erase, alter, or conceal content. They regularly do.

Ethereum can help keep the free world stay educated in light of the fact that it is decentralized.

The data put away on the Ethereum blockchain (information, brilliant agreements, dApps) can‚Äôt be closed somewhere around an administration or organization and will stay alive and uncensorable however long Ethereum is alive ‚Äì which could be for a long, long time.

Keeping individuals equipped for settling on instructed choices is one of the numerous reasons why Ethereum is significant. What‚Äôs more, presently is the best an ideal opportunity to purchase Ethereum and get ready for the finish of oversight.

This is one more motivation behind why 2021. may be a happy chance to purchase Ethereum and take part in the end of oversight.

## 4. Diversification ‚Äì Ethereum, Bitcoin and more

Ethereum‚Äôs innovation and object are not quite the same as Bitcoin.

We know why Bitcoin is a wise venture ‚Äì however is Ethereum a surprisingly better purchase?

Bitcoin was at first intended to be a cryptographic money ‚Äì accentuation on ‚Äòcash.‚Äô Ethereum is unique and is planned to be a stage for keen agreements.

With Bitcoin, you can store worth and pay for things, while with Ethereum, you can program keen agreements, tokenize resources, and that‚Äôs only the tip of the iceberg.

Ethereum is additionally OK at being an installment framework as well, however it doesn‚Äôt have the brand mindfulness and changelessness of Bitcoin ‚Äì in addition to Bitcoin is really scant since it‚Äôs covered at 21 million coins ‚Äì while Ethereum is uncapped.",ethereum,1616998541,manishghatpande,0,1,True,2021-03-28

What's the difference between attestation and finality?,"When describing attestation, the ethereum.org website says:

""If a validator isn't chosen to propose a new shard block, they'll have to attest to another validator's proposal and confirm that everything looks as it should. It's the attestation that is recorded in the beacon chain, rather than the transaction itself.

At least 128 validators are required to attest to each shard block ‚Äì this is known as a ""committee"".""

When describing finality it says:

""In distributed networks, a transaction has ""finality"" when it's part of a block that can't change.

To do this in proof-of-stake, Casper, a finality protocol, gets validators to agree on the state of a block at certain checkpoints. So long as 2/3 of the validators agree, the block is finalised. Validators will lose their entire stake if they try and revert this later on via a 51% attack.""

sorry if this question is obvious, but I am still kind of new to the whole crypto scene. I got a bit confused with hard forks (HF), especially with respect to the upcoming Berlin HF and later London HFs.

In the past, whenever a HF occured and a network branched into two, there were also two coins associated. The main branch and coin continues to work without any interaction by the user. however, if an address contained coins at the time of the fork, the holder can claim the equivalent amount of coins on the second branch, like for ETC or BCH.

Now I know with Ada you can move it to the ledger x, then to yoroi and stake that way, being secure.

Simple ethereum question - unlimited supply?,"Hello there. I tried to post this in the cryptocurrency subreddit but didn't have the required comment karma.

I understand that ethereum has an unlimited supply, unlike bitcoin or cardano, that is created at an ever decreasing rate. However, if the amount of ethereum is always increasing, even with mass adoption, won't it's worth eventually drop as supply outpaces demand? Isn't it more of a sure bet to invest in coins with limited supply?

I'm not knocking ethereum. I think it is an amazing technology and I am excited about ethereum 2.0 and the improvement of smart contracts. I just want to understand how the unlimited cap plays into price when compared to other coins.",ethereum,1616943060,baabaablacksheep4,35,2,True,2021-03-28

A brain dump on PoS vs PoW arguments,"I just listened to the ultrasound money podcast by Justin Drake ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWqhn1hXvVc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWqhn1hXvVc)) and the critique by ck\_snarks ( [http://povcryptopod.btc.libsynpro.com/debating-bitcoin-security-and-ultra-sound-money](http://povcryptopod.btc.libsynpro.com/debating-bitcoin-security-and-ultra-sound-money) ). I found myself agreeing with Justin and disagreeing with the critique on most points, my two main disagreements with Justin being that (i) his concrete estimates on the cost to attack BTC really were a bit low, and (ii) the ""Bitcoin is a battery"" meme is dumb and we should let/help it die (see this [excellent parody](https://twitter.com/deadalnix/status/1375425953007079429) from deadalnix), though to his credit Justin did use the analogy in a different way. I also find that some of my disagreements with the critique are disagreements with deeper points that get brought up by the pro-PoW side regularly.

## It really is relative security, and not absolute security, that matters

One criticism that was made to Justin's claim that the long-run economics of fixed-supply PoW are not good is that while the BTC-denominated block reward has been going down, the _USD-denominated_ block reward has been going up, and the latter is what matters because it determines the actual level of security. **This is wrong. The reason why it is wrong is that the security needs of a thing have to be proportional to the size of that thing, because as a thing gets bigger, its enemies become bigger and more well-motivated.** If BTC were 100x as big as it is today, the value from destroying it would be 100x higher, and the kinds of actors that would want to care about destroying it would be much bigger and scarier. This is also why countries of all sizes have roughly similarly sized militaries as a percentage of GDP. Hence, cost of attack divided by market cap really is the correct statistic to measure, and in the long run issuance-free PoW really does look not that good.

## Models really are good at seeing the long-term big picture here

I won't go into this in too much detail; instead I will link my own model from November: [https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/06/pos2020.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/06/pos2020.html)

This gives the deep fundamental reasons why we should generally expect PoS to have a much higher security/cost ratio than PoW, which are independent of the specifics of any single algorithm or era. It's better to focus on that than to hinge the entire argument on (necessarily rough and low-information) calculations made with specific assumptions about manufacturers.

## ""Even if they can attack, why would they? It's not in their interests""

One common argument that gets made to assuage fears of a miner or pool getting 51% hashpower is: even if they do, why would they attack? That would destroy the golden goose that lays their eggs; it's not in their interests. But in reality, we cannot assume this; not only does it assume rationality, it assumes _lack of outside incentives_. The whole point of having high levels of security is to protect against attackers with outside incentives to break the chain. **This is why my own approach to thinking about PoS security is ""if they have $X billion, _how many times can they break the chain before all their money gets slashed?_""**. It's not about assuming rationality; it's only assuming limits on bad actors' economic resources.

""Trust a single actor because they have economic incentives"" is a security model fit for centralized systems, not for blockchains.

## Once you can do one type of 51% attack on a PoW chain, you really can do them all

A point made near the end of the critique podcast was that it's not correct to think of 51% attacks as being a single type of thing, because different kinds of attacks are different: censoring or reverting hours of activity requires hours of work, but censoring or reverting months of activity requires months of work, which is hundreds of times more. Once again, I disagree, and I actually think the approach of treating ""51% attack capability"" as a single thing is correct. This is because **the bulk of the cost of an attack is hardware costs** (last time I tried to estimate this, [it was 2/3 hardware, 1/3 electricity](https://eth.wiki/concepts/proof-of-stake-faqs#what-about-capital-lockup-costs)). Hence, once you have the capability to attack for even a day, you're most of the way there to attacking as many times as you want until the community gives up and changes the PoW algo (or, better yet, moves to PoS).

The only exception I might grant is that one could hack into or shut down mining pools for a short period of time, but doing this for longer than a few hours is harder because the legitimate pool operators could respond, but it's worth remembering that the numbers of ""$5 (or 10) billion to attack BTC"" _were already based on the attacker not being able to do this and having to get the hardware the hard way_.

## Miners contribute to non-greenness even if they are green

Energy is a semi-fungible market. Even if all BTC miners in the world were super-virtuous and made sure to only use very clean energy, the net effect of such a change would be that the cost of green energy for everyone else would go up (this is basic supply/demand mechanics) while the cost of non-green energy for everyone else would remain unchanged. Hence, the _other_ businesses that care about the environment the least would use less green energy and more non-green energy.

Additionally, the environment is not the only negative externality; there are plenty of cases of mining farms using subsidized electricity (eg. see [this one that got caught](https://news.bitcoin.com/iran-seizes-45000-bitcoin-miners-for-illegally-using-subsidized-government-electricity-report/)), so their use of electricity also adds a negative externality to local fiscal budgets.

## Monetary premium really is a meme, and not ""the basic properties of reality manifesting themselves""

An argument in the critique podcast has David arguing that monetary premium of an asset is a Schelling point (aka meme, aka [legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html)) that arises from implicit social coordination. CK says that this is false, and it's the inherent properties of the asset that make it win out.

I'm once again siding with David here; the world really does run on social coordination and memes, and cryptocurrency is arguably even entrenching that, not somehow getting away from it. The proof of this is simple: compare Bitcoin and any of the PoW fork coins that came after it. The only difference between them is that Bitcoin came first - a factor which has zero influence on its technical properties, but _a lot_ of influence on meme value. One could argue that Bitcoin also has higher hashpower, but this is missing the fact that _hashpower is itself caused by monetary premium_. If some other PoW asset had a higher value and block reward tomorrow, the hashpower of the chain maintaining that asset would also be higher. Also, I just doubt that most people really understand or care about the difference between 15 exahashes and 150 exahashes.

## What the pro-PoW arguments get right

Perhaps the best argument that was made or alluded to is that the physical hardware-driven nature of it adds friction even to very well-capitalized attackers: you need to wait a year for the hardware to get manufactured, the process necessarily involves many people, and there's a high risk that it gets detected while you're doing it. This is a genuine advantage of PoW. That said, it also has its flipsides: as Justin said in his podcast, it's very hard to mine at significant scales without being caught, whereas PoS is much more censorship-resistant.

Arguments about PoW as a distribution model are also fair and important; plenty of pure-PoS coins end up launching with _very_ concentrated token supplies. That said, as Justin and others have mentioned Ethereum too benefits from that due to its ~6 years of mining, even though it is now switching to PoS.",ethereum,1616945458,vbuterin,129,1,True,2021-03-28

"Can we get real about Optimism, please?","Hear me out. Just over a month ago, Optimism blogged that they hired all this new talent and that they would be launching mainnet instead of the public testnet this march. 

https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/dope-hires-moar-mainnet-in-march-174fa8966361

Also, back in September, Optimism blogged their roadmap and informed that synthetic, uniswap, and chainlink would be integrated onto the testnet so they would be ready to go when mainnet was, stating ""we will be preparing some of our other early adopters for testnet integrations so that they are ready to deploy once the full testnet is running.""

https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-c390a05bbcb8

Then we learn the other day that Optimism is delayed. Interestingly, when recently asked on Discord why Optimism needed to wait until they (synthetix, uniswap, chainlink) were ready, Jinglan said:

""We especially want things like token bridges, infrastructure providers, block explorers, multisigs, wallets, etc. to be ready for launch so people can use L2 as safely as possible . . . [i]n order for a project to upgrade safely, we need to integrate a multisig prior to launch. Other things in this category include oracles, indexers, etc.""

Just wow. And chainlink hasn't deployed anything yet?!  Notably, Chainlink already has price feeds on xDai and their oracles are ready as well (with documentation). But were told Chainlink was an ""integration partner, but for the last 6 months they've done basically nothing? No price feeds. Not even oracles? Amazing. 

Soooo just barely a month ago, Jinlang and company didn't have any idea that mainnet wouldn't be ready in March? That Chainlink, an integration partner doesn't even have price feeds, but that mainnet would be ready in March? They didn't even have block explorers or wallets ready? Lol. Smh.  

I understand that projects get delayed, but this is pretty alarming. How can we possibly trust or rely on anything Optimism says at this rate? This whole situation is unfortunate and unacceptable at this point. It's no wonder xDai and polygon are eating into Ethereum's market share. Jinglan, can you get it together please? 

P.S. I love ETH and have been hodling since 2017. I'm just pissed at the lack of urgency surrounding L2 solutions and and how this is panning out.",ethereum,1616953065,boot_knocker_,263,1,True,2021-03-28

NFT - The Cryptobro Scam,"Don't mean to be a wrecking ball to you builders but... I believe that all the artists who were promised a platform for selling their artwork should consider that it's a hopeless venture.

It's all about that legitimization of the currency, more users with a guarenteed value increase. The people who spend millions on artworks are just trying to make news articles to perpetuate that cycle. Those same people have already invested a boat load in the currency and are waiting for onlookers to bolster their investment. No doubt they made the money they spent on the artwork back amost immediately.

As an artist you wont make your millions because the space is now flooded with other artists trying to make their millions. There are only so many articles that can be written, so only a small handful of artists make money. 

Now you can argue that smaller scale transactions are being made by onlookers and a little bit of movement is happening. But for the majority, the promise of a new platform for artists is a lie and all the Cryto themed art will be a bad taste in every artists mouth once people realise it's not worth the effort.

Tie this along with the environmental impact, well fuck me, you got an army of disappointed artists and bad press, and soon you'll run out of moves and the next best thing is to sell sell sell and forget the whole thing!

EIP-3368 - Changes the block reward paid to proof-of-work (POW) to 3 ETH from existing 2 ETH and starts a decay schedule for next two years to 1 ETH Block Reward.,"We are looking for community feedback for EIP-3668 as it will be discussed in the ACD meeting on 3/19/2021

Motivation

A sudden drop in PoW mining rewards could result in a sudden precipitous decrease in mining profitability that may drive miners to auction off their hashrate to the highest bidder while they figure out what to do with their now ""worthless"" hardware. If enough hashrate is auctioned off in this way at the same time, an attacker will be able to rent a large amount of hashing power for a short period of time at relatively low cost vs. reward and potentially attack the network. By setting the block reward to X (where X is enough to offset the sudden profitability decrease) and then decreasing it over time to Y (where Y is a number below the sudden profitability decrease), we both avoid introducing long term inflation while at the same time spreading out the rate that individual miners cross into a transitional range. 

This approach offers a higher level of confidence and published schedule of yield, while allowing mining participants time to gracefully repurpose/sell their hardware. This greatly increases ethereums PoW security by keeping incentives aligned to ethereum and not being force projected to short term brokerage for the highest bidder. Additionally the decay promotes a known schedule of a deflationary curve, aligning to the overall Minimal Viable Issuance directive aligned to a 2 year transition schedule for Proof of Stake, consensus replacement of Proof of Work. Security is paramount in cryptocurrency blockchains and the risk to a 51% non-resistant chain is real. The scope of Ethereum's current hashrate has expanded to hundreds of thousands of new participants and over 2.5x original ATH hashrate/difficulty. While the largest by hashrate crypto is bitcoin, ethereum is not far behind the total network size in security aspects. This proposal is focused to keep that superiority in security one of the key aspects.

"EIP-3368: Increase block rewards to 3 ETH, with 2 Year Decay to 1 ETH","Simple Summary

Changes the block reward paid to proof-of-work (POW) miners to 3 ETH from existing 2 ETH and starts a decay schedule for next two years to 1 ETH Block Reward.

¬†Abstract

Set the block reward to 3 ETH and then decrease it slightly every block for 4,724,000 blocks (approximately 2 years) until it reaches 1 ETH.

¬†Motivation

A sudden drop in PoW mining rewards could result in a sudden precipitous decrease in mining profitability that may drive miners to auction off their hashrate to the highest bidder while they figure out what to do with their now ‚Äúworthless‚Äù hardware.

Ethereum in the 2021 Ultimate Crypto Tournament,"Hi everyone, forgive the shameless announcement, but I‚Äôm a real person doing this and a nerd for tournaments. The only way I know to let people know about this is to blast messages. If this gets more downvotes than upvotes, I‚Äôll F off.

That said, guess what‚Ä¶it‚Äôs tourney time and you‚Äôre in!

Ethereum is the #1 seed in its own bracket. Your opponent is 16 seed Nexo. Last year, ETH made it to the Elite 8. Good luck this year!

If you‚Äôre familiar with March Madness, or remember this from last year, you‚Äôll get it right away. If not, this is how it works: Starting tonight at midnight, on Twitter @ UltimateCrypto7, there will be a poll for each game, open to all. The coin receiving more votes after 3 days will be declared the winner and move on.

Like last year, the Ultimate Crypto Tournament pits the top 64 coins (by market cap) in a single elimination tournament. Crypto is a collaborative, cooperative space with room for all, but we can still have some fun.

So, vote early, tell your friends, and may the best coin win! The games begin at midnight tonight and run until 11:59 pm PT March 18.

An extensive list of earning strategies and DeFi protocols in the Ethereum ecosystem,"**Introduction.** DeFi is the future of finance with equal opportunities. Despite being at its inception, with currently more than $40 billion in total value locked (TVL) \[1\], there exist already plenty of opportunities for you to make your idle crypto tokens do the hard work for you to earn some interest. Some of the strategies offer a high risk-reward ratio, whereas some are rather safer. Many people do not know where to start with DeFi because the term itself is a buzzword (e.g., similar to the term BigData) with ambiguous meanings that get people easily lost. DeFi encapsulates various decentralized financial services whose functionality is immutable and persisted on (Ethereum) blockchain, which simply means these services are *accessible to anyone under the same rules and conditions*, which is a huge difference from traditional financial (tradFi) services. DeFi offers various strategies and this extensive guide should outline and uncover the most common earning strategies -- including advantages and disadvantages -- in the Ethereum ecosystem. The strategies proceed from the more mainstream and community-approved ones to more advanced ones, concluding with inspiring platforms and trends.

5. Miscellaneous: yield-bearing NTF¬¥s, synthetic assets, future yield markets, self-paying loans
6. Links and resources

**1 STAKING**

This is not DeFi per se, but to make the list complete, I will start with this, as ETH 2.0 staking is the *most important strategy* that can not only grant you passive income but also helps *keep the network decentralized and safe*. Also, the rewards compared to traditional finance are very appealing.

**1.1 ETH 2.0 staking**

    rewards: ~8% APR

There has been written a lot about staking already, for those who are interested to read more, the best start is Etehreum official website \[2\]. Several variants exist (self, validator-as-a-service, stake pools, custody, exchange) each of which suits better for people at different skill levels or involvement.

|\[+\] Ultimate HODL strategy|\[-\] Tokens are locked indefinitely|
|:-|:-|
|\[+\] Low-risk strategy as this functionality is supported natively in the ETH protocol|\[-\] Slashing penalties for offline time|

**1.2 Staking ERC-20 tokens**

Tokens: *Aave (LEND \[3\], Synthetix (SNX) \[4\], Sushi \[5\], Curve (CRV) \[6\], Badger \[7\], The Graph (GRT) \[8\], and many others...)*

    rewards: various, ranging from 3% APR

There exist many tokens on Ethereum that incentivize users to lock their tokens to earn staking rewards for various activities: computation (e.g., verifying transactions), asset collateralization, governance -- or no activity at all (\~reward distribution tokens).

|\[+\] Earning interest on your favorite coins|\[-\] Risk of token price depreciation in projects that are not mainstream or that have a long-term token issuance scheme|
|:-|:-|


**2 LENDING**

dApps: *Compound \[9\], Aave\[10\]*

You can provide your tokens to be lent to borrowers at (usually variable) interest rates. Some exchanges and centralized services offer these services as well. Lending rewards are typically low for leading crypto projects (ETH, wBTC) but are very interesting for stablecoins.

**2.1 Stablecoin lending**

    rewards: 3‚Äì30% APR

You lock your stablecoins into a vault. All the tokens in the vault earn the same reward. The interest rate fluctuates depending on the demand. Usually, in bull markets, the APR is higher than in bear markets. The reward is around 3-30% APR. Compounding these rewards can slightly improve the rates, supposing the provider offers in-built compounding solutions (otherwise it does not pay-off to pay the high TX fees to claim rewards repeatedly).

|\[+\] Better rates compared to tradFi, but essentially on the same asset (dollars)|\[+\] Low-risk strategy only depending on external factors (stablecoin losing peg)|
|:-|:-|
|\[+/-\] Stablecoins keep their price (disadvantage in bull markets, advantage in bear markets)||

**2.2 ETH, wETH, wBTC lending**

    rewards: 0.15‚Äì3% APR

Wrapped ETH (ETH is not ERC-20 token) and wrapped BTC (wBTC, renBTC) can be lend or staked to provide a yield that is in general rather low, but for holders with bigger stacks, it can be a very effective way to earn stable income on the two most mainstream cryptocurrencies.

|\[+\] You HODL your crypto and you get a small additional income|
|:-|


**3 LIQUIDITY PROVIDING**

dApps: *uniswap\[11\], sushi\[12\], 1inch\[13\], Loopring\[14\] (L2)*

    rewards: up to 100%¬¥s APR (with rewards)

Decentralized exchanges (DEX) run automated liquidity pools in order to facilitate the swaps (i.e., exchange trades). Users can provide liquidity for a DEX-traded pair by locking both assets to the pool, at 1:1 volume at their current corresponding price ratio. By locking the assets, you are eligible to earn the fixed fees (around 0.3%) of every trade, proportional to your stake in the liquidity pool. It makes sense to lock assets that you want to hold anyways and in the long-term, e.g., ETH/stablecoin pairs. New pairs are very often incentivized in providing liquidity by offering rewards schemes.

|\[+\] Acquiring a reasonable proportion of the pool that has high trading volume can generate interesting profits|\[-\] Inter-pair token price fluctuations or decline to $0 lead to permanent and impermanent losses|
|:-|:-|
|\[+\] Many liquidity pools are incentivized by token providers or DEXes by additional token rewards that might severely boost the interest|\[-\] Pools with low or no liquidity provide unstable ratios|

**4 YIELD FARMING**

dApps: *yearn\[15\], curve\[6\], badger\[16\], harvest.finance\[17\], alphahomora\[18\] (leveraged farming), and many others...*

    rewards: up to 100%¬¥s APY

In typical staking, lending, or liquidity-providing scenarios, there is no compounding. In other words, you have to claim your rewards manually to earn them and re-stake them to compound your interests.  Some of the farming protocols collect the rewards for you. Yield farming basically removes or socializes the transaction fees to claim the rewards, which means that your earned interest is continuously compounding which increases the APR (to APY) without the need of repeatedly interacting with the smart contract which is expensive. Some aggressive yield farming strategies focus on harvesting both yields AND rewards from various protocols and compound all of them, which can make them very profitable in short term.

|\[+\] Very high rewards (100+% APY is not problem)|\[-\] Some farmed assets cease to exist leaving you with permanent losses|
|:-|:-|
|\[+\] Farming aggregators (e.g., harvest.finance) offer multiple strategies and additionally offer interesting reward tokenomics|\[-\] Many strategies are short term only and are not worth paying high TX fees|

**5 MISCELLANEOUS**

There are many wonderful projects around that attract and deserve attention and offer plausible earning strategies.

**a) Yield farming on non-fungible tokens (NFT)**

dApps: *Syncbonds\[19\], VeryNifty\[20\]*

Reward generating NFT tokens. Cryptobonds\[19\] are tradable high reward-generating NFTs that lock up interest-bearing liquidity pool tokens. You can emit your own bond, participate in emitting one with others, or buy already emitted bonds on the open market.

With VeryNifty\[20\], you can wrap your NFTS and turn them into vNFTs that earn you interest in the MUSE token. Careful conditions apply that might burn your NTFs. There is a [uniswap pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0xc2BdE1A2fA26890c8E6AcB10C91CC6D9c11F4a73/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2) to stake and generate yields and trade HashMasks.

**b) Synthetic assets**

dApps: *Synthetix \[21\], Mirror\[22\]*

Synthetic assets are derivatives that are incentivized to hold the price peg to the underlying asset (stock, fund, commodity). The main advantage of ""synths"" that anyone can get immutable exposure to any asset at any time (looking at you Robinhood traders). The disadvantage is that you do not really own the stock so you can not partake in ongoing short squeeze (looking at you GME apes). Ensuring the collateral to back up the synthetic asset pair with stablecoin can earn you good rewards while exposing you to the stock at the same time. The leading projects are Synthetix\[21\] and Mirror.finance\[22\] that uses its Terra UST cross-chain stablecoin.

**c) Future yield tokenization**

dApps: *APwine\[23\], Syncbonds\[19\]*

Imagine you can stake your tokens to gain future yields without locking the tokens and imagine you can sell these interest-bearing tokens INCLUDING its future yield in advance (for some discount, or even premium if you are lucky or smart). Sounds like a Matrix loophole. The markets are so far rather small, but the APwine\[23\] project is worth keeping eye on.

**d) Self-paying loans - alchemix**

dApps: *Alchemix\[24\]*

Alchemix\[24\] lets you take loans that do not generate debt for you but yield. You deposit a certain amount of crypto as collateral and you are able to withdraw up to its half as ""loan to yourself"". The other half is getting paid automatically by farming strategies.

How does an NFT really let somebody own something?,"I have read up on NFTs recently and about how people can become the ‚Äúowner‚Äù of an artwork. I‚Äôm new to it and there are a few things that I struggle to understand. 

Many articles I have read describe how they would upload their digital artwork, usually their source file, to somewhere that has a download link to it. I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs either a Cloud storage or IPFS. And this download link to the source file is submitted together on Rarity when creating the token. When a buyer buys that token, he owns that artwork which is supposed to be referenced by that token and also gets access to the download link to its source file. 

Now, what happens if one of the buyers in the chain of selling/reselling leaks that source file? Isn‚Äôt that token now pointless? 

Also, when a buyer has bought that token and gotten access to the source file, he could have just downloaded it and then resell that token right away because he now owns that actual source file and owning that token isn‚Äôt valuable anymore, wouldn‚Äôt it? In fact, now that he has the download link already, he can download it again and again even after he has resold the token! If he is generous, he could share that download link with his friends too.

Or he could even use that source file to regenerate the artwork, change some colours and now call it his own work, create an NFT for it, and resell it as an original work again.

Lastly, when submitting the link to download the source file of the artwork on Rarity, is that download link stored within the token that can only be decrypted by the owner‚Äôs private key in order to reveal the download link? Or is that download link simply stored on Rarity‚Äôs database and referenced by the NFT? If the download link was stored on Rarity‚Äôs database, what validation and value does my token even have if Rarity happens to close down one day and access to that link is gone together?",ethereum,1615688915,decorumic,37,3,True,2021-03-13

Eth 2.0 staking question,"Based on the current rewards ([https://twitter.com/eth2bot?s=21](https://twitter.com/eth2bot?s=21)) you can generate 8.32% in returns per year for staking 32 eth.

However the returns don't compound directly onto the validator that generates them.  In order to compound the returns, you need generate 32 eth worth and start a new validator.  This design seems a little odd to me.

It means that at current returns if you had 385 eth you could compound the returns every year.  At 12 times that you can compound every month.  I don't understand this decision as it makes the rich get richer by design.  Especially given that the returns decrease the more eth that is staked, so after each compounding the rich get a larger share of a decreasing reward.

Does anyone know why this decision was made, versus simply allowing returns to compound on the validator that generated them (which seems fairer for all)?

Ether TX out of Gas,"Hi,

I wanted to send my ETH from my Jaxx wallet to an exchange, but some Tx didn't get mined or had a too low mining fee/gas limit set, I don't know the actual reason, sorry :(

I imported the private keys to another wallet and then I could send everything.

However, some transactions stuck and the amount is now lost:

"A moment please, if you are feeling blue or depressed on this evening","One of the younger coworkers at our employ has begun bringing her daughter in with her so she can do school work and not be alone all day. Full disclosure, many employees do as a lot of them are single parents and childcare has sky rocketed in our part of New England. We have turned the break room into a sort of one room digital school house and it has actually been a delight to have them. I myself have continued to bring my geriatric cat and he spends his days 'supervising' and they call him Professor Mreowser. Honestly he is more of a distraction than a help at times but he let's the little ones hold him and in other moments, sits next to the older kids and accepts their petting as they listen to their lectures and read their lessons. 

Anyhow, I apologize for the tangent but it will come around to a point, I promise. The other day, I myself was having a bit of a rough moment myself as I continue the never ending search of cutting corners and saving at every possible turn so I dont have to reduce hours or wages or make anything harder on them than it already has been. We are afloat, and have lost no one from our work family (very important on a personal level as I have no biological family to speak of, and have known many of them for years). I was sitting out back, feeling very despondent and just beaten, and damn near wishing that after all these years I could believe in a god  because even that would be an improvement at this point.

Regardless, I thought I was having a solitary moment when one of the younger kiddos came out back because she wanted it to be her turn with Professor Mreowsers but one of the big ones didn't want to move him or move away from him until the end of their test because he was good luck. While she came begging for intervention, when she looked up from the ground and at me she immediately stopped talking and just stared at me for a few seconds.

I'm not great with kids, so I kinda just nodded at her and forced a smile. Her reaction was everything. She kinda shuffled and poked my knee and said sometimes my mom looks like that. When she does, we sing this song from the radio together and it helps. She said ""bitches aren't shit and they dont say nothing. 100 mf'ers cannot tell me nothing. Its cause a bee's in the trap, the bee bees in the trap."" She than nodded and left (yes, I had to ask her to repeat it a few minutes ago to record this accurately.

I dont know what the hell it means , but her tone and her tiny face staring at me and saying it with total conviction like it was an undisputed fact did make me smile and made my day better.

Hopefully this makes your day better too if you have had a rough hour or day or year.

I will promote now because I promised her when  I had her repeat the words for me. We are in a coin named $SCAT. Professor Mreowser was a rescue over two decades ago, and that community donates every two weeks to a different shelter to help cats and kittens who still haven't found their home. No, it isn't some vague promise, the community has already begun doing it. If you could put a penny or a nickle into $SCAT and help us vote Nashua Humane Society (New Hampshire) to be the receiving shelter at this weekends vote, it would mean a lot. I'd like to be able to show them Monday that  they made a difference for all the hurting cats in our city  next Monday. If that isn't something financially feasible for you at this time, that's okay, and you will get through this and things will get better. If you join us this weekend to vote, please feel free to take back you nickel on Monday, and you have my genuine thanks for helping make the kids feel that they helped their city. If you want to leave your nickel and vote every other week with us, welcome, and please leave your local shelter, wherever it is in the world down below, and let me and the employees and their kiddos vote with you next time for your community.

April Fools Day fast approaches üò±ü§î what will be??,"Ethereum is very healthy as we see the implementation for EIP-1559 finalised for July via conference call on the weekend past, this upgrade will transition out of the high gas fees to a system of eth fees being burnt in the network- literally burning eth- thus causing it to become a semi/ or entirely deflationary asset, from an economics standpoint this comes with words of caution as deflationary assets can become a horded and protected asset thus stifling the economy, however in the crypto economy this is fantastic- Bitcoin is considered deflationary as a point of reference. 
This is fantastic news for the future value of ethereum. 

However, with that said, the mining community is furious as they will no longer receive their average rewards of 3 ETH per block they transact, there is varying sentiment in the community, with the more extreme and disgruntled attempting to organise a systematic strike of sorts for April 1 in response to the developers decision. 

While this group represents a select few in the community, it represents the loudest, as we have seen in crypto buy the rumour sell the news, in this case we have the inverse situation. And might be able to expect some fantastic buying opportunities with ethereum as April approaches. 

My personal inkling is the miners will make a lot of noise, but fail miserably to consolidate any where close to the required hashing power to evidence to the eth developers and team alike that they pose any threat. It is also highly illogical to do so as it represents semi-centralisation and it is entirely inimical to the network they support. 

In summary, I believe it is very small minority of the mining community, making a lot of noise, and the transition should occur without issue.

Is it worth trading ETH on margin with Kraken?,"Hi All,

I'm a crypto noob who is looking to start investing some money in crypto, I've noted a few down but I am very impressed with Eth out of all of the crypto, I have noticed that kraken offers margin on it and I am not sure if it's worth it or not especially with the random dips and volatility of crypto from time to time. If I put in 750 pounds in eth (around 1000 dollars) is it worth it to get like 2x-3x margin on it or just put in the money? I will be very likely be holding it for a looong time and I will be putting in 100-150 each month as well and I am not too sure how margin would work if I just hold it for a long time.

Ethereum‚Äôs layer 2 and EIP1559 solutions in comparison to Cardano‚Äôs network,"TLDR

Layer 2 solutions: These are several solutions that don‚Äôt run on the main net and improve Ethereum‚Äôs scalability and transaction speed. A way of imagining these solutions is like the highways that take traffic off the main net to reduce congestion. However, fees have to be paid when transferring from layer 1 to layer 2, so fees could remain high if congestion is high.

EIP1559: Establishes the market rate for transactions, so people don‚Äôt have to guess the gas fee. In addition, the majority of Ethereum is burned in the transaction, which creates a deflationary mechanism. Gas fees are determined by congestion, so they could remain high. 

Discussion 

There seems to be lots of hype behind these two solutions at the moment on the internet fixing Ethereum‚Äôs high gas fees. However, I don‚Äôt see these two solutions actually fixing the high gas fee‚Äôs on Ethereum if congestion remains high on the main net.

PHUCK BABY BOOMERS,"[PHUCK BABY BOOMERS: The NFT to define a generation.](https://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:365599:0x4d9c6f7980965d31e92e60d89d860acf034ba128)

Baby boomers (often shortened to boomers) are the demographic cohort following the Silent Generation and preceding Generation X. The generation is generally defined as people born from 1946 to 1964, during the post‚ÄìWorld War II baby boom.  Baby boomers are often parents of late Gen Xers and Millennials.  Arguably the worst generation in human history, boomers have been responsible for the following: 

* The worst economic recession since the Great Depression 
* Jim Cramer 
* Two of the three largest transfers of wealth from the working class to the top 1.00% in American history.  These two events were the 2008 stock market crash and the Covid-19 pandemic. 
* The greatest gap in income equality in American history. 
* All-time high CEO pay with all other wages remaining stagnant 
* The Covid-19 pandemic. 
* Staying in jobs longer because they failed to secure a retirement, thus keeping younger generations out of the workforce and unable to start their adult lives. 
* A 300% rise in college tuition costs. A 6.8% daily compounding student loan interest rate and over $1.71 trillion in student loan debt crippling an entire generation. 
* Passage of the Controlled Substances Act which turned drug use and addiction into a criminal problem rather than a public health crisis disproportionately affecting minorities. 
* Four out of the top five longest running wars in American History surpassing only the war that fucking founded the country. 
* Ronald Reagan, whose failed economic plan is responsible for some of the above atrocities, not to mention his ramping up of the War on Drugs with the ultimate ignorant statement, ""Just Say No"". 
* The birth of Helicopter Parents, who prevent kids from freely hanging out around the neighborhood because they've instilled the fear that they will be kidnapped, raped, and or murdered, despite the statistical fact that these are all far more likely to be perpetuated by family or a family friend. 
* The highest divorce rate of any generation. 
* The creation of the 24-hour news network/propaganda machine. 
* The lowest rated Congress in recorded history. 
* Oh, and did I mention, Jim Cramer‚Ä¶

Despite a proven track record of doing the most to be the worst, boomers continue to believe that ‚Äúthey gave their children a better life than they had.‚Äù  Unable to even contemplate considering their shortcomings, the average boomer is riddled with the ‚Äúholier-than-thou‚Äù attitude. They were set up for success by their parents and the thriving state of the world economy, they changed the rules at their own discretion to maximize their greed, and they had a total disregard for the passing the baton of the environmental and fiscal state of the world to their offspring.  Perhaps the worst characteristic embodied by the boomers is the constant harassment about how lazy young‚Äôuns are nowadays and how easy it is to make money.  They didn‚Äôt leave the world a better place than when they inherited it.  Millennials will.

**‚ÄúPhuck Baby Boomers‚Äù:** When looking at this piece, a boomer is likely to respond by saying ‚ÄúI could have made this on Microsoft Paint‚Äù or ‚ÄúI can just screenshot this‚Äù.

Transferring wETH to ETH,"Hey everybody,

I'm pretty new to all of this Krypto- and NFT-Stuff, so maybe I'm just missing an obvious thing.

I tried bidding on some NFTs via Rarible.
I transferred 0.306 ETH from my ""MEW Wallet"" to wETH (Raribles Bidding currency). Since my bid failed, I now want to transfer those back to ETH into my Wallet. I tried doing this and it always fails. I can click the Button to transfer back, I set the amount (I also tried transferring less), and confirm the transaction within the app of MEW. But then it shows an error every time, even though i confirmed and verified it within the app.

MEW: 0.001 ETH
Rarible: 0.306 wETH

Is it because of the fees? Are those withdrawn from my Wallet and theres just not enough ETH on it? I thought the fees are withdrawn from my transferred amount.
What can I do to get my ETH back?

Making the ecosystem more light-client friendly,"One of the challenges of the current Ethereum ecosystem is that while the protocol is theoretically light client friendly, and [light clients even exist and can be used today](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/run-light-node-geth/), they're not nearly as commonplace as was originally envisioned. Particularly, all of the following environments _could have been_ secured by light clients, but are instead typically secured by APIs connected to centralized services:

1. Mobile phone clients/wallets, even those where the key management is trustless (Status, Argent, Loopring, etc etc)
2. In-browser wallets (Metamask et al)
3. Other blockchains

There are two main problems:

1. The Ethereum light client verification protocol _is not light enough_.
2. There's not enough incentive to _serve_ light clients, leading to weakened performance.

We can think of each of these two problems as being tied to a corresponding one of the two key parts of a light client protocol. The first part is to download and authenticate the **header chain**, giving you Merkle roots to transactions and history and state; this is the part that is stymied by the Ethereum light verification protocol's heaviness. The second part is, given the Merkle roots, to get Merkle branches for any data you want to learn so that you can authenticate the data.

### Light client verification of headers

(1) is a big deal. For a light client to stay synced with the eth-PoW network today, they need to sync the eth-PoW _header chain_, which is about 600 bytes per 13 seconds: trivial for a phone or browser app, but already getting expensive for the light-client-inside-a-blockchain use case. And in all three cases, it precludes the user-experience gain of instant syncing after a long time offline. Even worse, the PoW algorithm (ethash) takes a long time to verify. Despite being explicitly designed for light client friendliness with its ""cache"" mechanism, cache-based verification still takes a significant amount of time.

The beacon chain has some upgrades in store, coming in the [first hard fork](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/HF1_proposal), that allow light clients to stay synced with the beacon chain much more efficiently: a mere ~10 kB per day should suffice for basic connectivity. Verification will be significantly more computationally efficient than ethash.

Note that even before the merge, a light client of the beacon chain can double as a light client of the eth-PoW chain: the beacon chain contains a hash of an eth-PoW block about 10 hours old, and so a client could choose to use the beacon chain to sync up to that point and then download eth-PoW headers from there. This would not be nearly as efficient as pure beacon chain verification after the merge, but it would still be a considerable gain.

### Merkle branches

The problem with Merkle branches is simple. There are _a lot_ of potential light clients, and each light client wants to learn _a lot_ of information about the history and state, and it's expensive to send all that information and generate Merkle proofs for it. The problem is worse because there's no incentive to help send information, so relatively few nodes are doing it.

There are two main kinds of solutions to this problem:

1. Create a channel-payment protocol where nodes can get paid for supplying proofs.
2. Reorganize the p2p network to make providing proofs simpler and cheaper; see [Piper Merriam's work on this](https://github.com/ethereum/stateless-ethereum-specs).

But either path will take some time to get right, and there's a lot of work to be done (realistically there's a good chance we'll need to do both).

### A short term path

But we should not despair from the complexity of a fully functional light client network. **Even if all we can do is have a trustless header chain verifier, and we can't make a reliable and decentralized protocol to fetch Merkle branches, this by itself can greatly increase the security guarantees of mobile phone and in-browser clients**.

This is because instead of asking a server to provide responses to queries and trusting those responses, a wallet can now maintain the header chain locally, ask the server to provide responses along with Merkle proofs proving that the responses are correct, and verify the Merkle proofs. **This is an intermediate mode that would be nice to move the Ethereum ecosystem over to soon**. In the longer run, we can work harder on making a more fully decentralized light client ecosystem.",ethereum,1615247835,vbuterin,7,1,True,2021-03-08

Ethereum Exchange,"So you‚Äôve gone head to head with bots, scalpers, and kijiji deals gone wrong, but you have prevailed, you‚Äôve built a mining rig and it‚Äôs awesome! 

Now, what‚Äôs the next twist on this crazy ride? 

Well of course we have many options, some being:

-Hold on to your loot!

-Find an online business that offers goods for crypto 

-Buy and sell your coin on an exchange 

These are all fantastic options and widely used by many. What was that you asked? Oh you want to trade your digital dollar for some fiat? Of course you do, you need to pay off that rig right? Right.

Well this is the question that has me wondering as well. How do you trade your ETH for fiat dollars? Can it be done anonymously? Who offers this service? Are there preferred ‚Äúvendors‚Äù or options? How is this being done? The bottom line is, how do you cash your ETH in for fiat dollars with emphasis on anonymity?

Maybe it‚Äôs just me but I find this to be a slightly overlooked topic when it comes to searching for the right answers on the web.  Which brings me to this wonderful community with never ending buckets of knowledge. Will you folks point me in the right direction? Maybe a few tips and tricks?

As we all know Proof of Work is not environmentally completely optimal, though Bitcoin might still have an environmentally positive net effect on the environment due to less spending of a deflationary asset in the economy. Proof of Work and lack of throughput are the only things I don't like about Bitcoin. It seems Ethereum aims to solve both these issues through Proof of Stake and sharding. 

So to the question. Why don't everybody use Proof of Stake when it's environmentally superior? There must be downsides to it otherwise the choice would be given. Please keep a good tone.",ethereum,1614932989,misterbobdobalina09,42,12,True,2021-03-05

Interesting Ethereum Use Case? GoFundMe 2.0,"As I have been stewing all day about how I can externally fund some my PhD costs starting in September aside from work in the Summer I came to two ideas: I start an OnlyFans and hope that there is a niche market of creepy guys that are into average looking 6.5 to 7.5 (on a good day) / 10 guys doing weird shit, or I start a GoFundMe and pray that enough people give a shit about economics and invasive species that they'll pitch in to help me achieve that personal goal. 

But then I looked at my cryptos today like I always fucking do and I thought to myself: Wouldn't it be great if there was a GoFundMe for cryptos? And then I thought that it could potentially be an easy use case for a dapp on Ethereum. It would be sooo easy for the GoFundMe donators to see that when enough money gets put in the pool that the smart contract could execute and do what it needs to do in the objective of the GoFundMe. 

So if I said for example that I wanted to try and pay off part of my tuition, the smart contract would build up enough crypto equivalents from the donations and then execute on an exchange or something to convert to stablecoins and send to the target wallet address (the university). This way if I donate to the GoFundMe I know for damn sure it's going to where it should be going instead of ending up in some guys back pocket or lost to fucking UniSwap on a bad trade.",ethereum,1614816987,FondleMyFirn,14,15,True,2021-03-03

Proof of Stake Computing Power?,"Posted about this before but it got flagged as spam and deleted.

Simple question: If the network is currently burdened as-is, how will \*reducing\* the computing power by transitioning to proof-of-stake benefit the ""global computer"" that is the Ethereum network in the long run? Or is that not the goal for the network?

I know with Proof of Work, there's currently a lot of garbage bundled with meaningful computation to artificially inflate the workload as a distribution mechanism. Will removing that garbage and vacating all of that computing power still leave a powerful cloud computer in its place? Or will the network's total computing potential be hugely cut back without hundreds of thousands of GPU and teraflops committed to the task?   


I guess it's a hybrid proof-of-stake, but the network without that garbage must still have steep computing demands, especially if it were to continue growing.",ethereum,1614832222,Maergoth,16,2,True,2021-03-03

List GWEI in $USD as well,"I totally get the reluctance to do so, but we really do need to express all this GWEI stuff in $ USD as well.

Why?

Cos it takes a loooong time to really get used to a new currency.

I've lived in SE Asia for about 16 years now, and I know it was at LEAST 5 years before I stopped looking at prices and quickly calculating what that meant in ""real"" money.

Now, today, I genuinely look at prices in Malaysian ringgit, and if I see a price in GBP or USD I now do the opposite, and quickly calculate what the heck that means in ringgit!

My point is money, and its currency, is really, really, deeply embedded in our heads. We cannot comfortably spend money without a little voice in the back of our head figuring it out in 'real money'. 

We can deny that, each of us can claim to be an exception, that you're so yung n trendi that you're not affected - but yes you are, and sure as heck noobs coming in are.

Can smart contracts be developed to support businesses that require Trust accounts?,"Hello everyone,

I  have read many articles on Smart Contracts, but I am no expert  whatsoever.  I am still trying to learn and understand the concept of  Smart contracts, and how it can be applied to complex situations such as  the one described in the title.

I  run a small business that requires monies to be paid into a Trust  account until work is completed.  Furthermore, the interest (if any)  must be paid to a specific organization.  The business also requires  confidentiality to be considered by a governing body; which I believe  can be worked out since transactions do not need details when posted  onto the blockchain (AFAIK).

I would like to revolutionize my industry of work by adopting cryptocurrency to my business.

So  my question is: can Smart Contracts be implemented in a way where it  can act as a Trust holder, and pay out any necessary interest (if  accrued)?",ethereum,1614865032,SolidusViper,6,13,True,2021-03-04

I understand that the smart contracts associated with NFTs can allow artists to receive perpetual royalties from resales of their digital art, as this is all executed online, including the delivery of the art. 

When it comes to physical art though, how would you go about including the percentage royalty in the NFT for physical art? Is it a matter as simple as it is with digital art where you just execute everything online except for delivery of the art? 

Could someone walk me through how this process might work with physical art? Are there any extra challenges compared to doing this with digital art? 

Really appreciate it if anyone has knowledge on this and would be willing to share! Any resources where I might learn more about this would also be amazing. 

Thanks so much!",ethereum,1614700819,hyraw,38,1,True,2021-03-02

"With NFT on the rise, is it legal to buy and sell art depicting celebrities/athletes etc?","Say you draw a painting or caricature or make an animation or 3D model of a celebrity or character like Lady Gaga, Elon Musk, Bob Marley, Brad Pitt, Batman, PewDiePie, Floyd Mayweather etc

Is it legal to sell and or buy this sort of artwork in the NFT space? 

Would one get sued? Would the work get taken down? If I purchase one artwork and the celebrity sues the artist and wins, do I lose my artwork after I paid? If that was to happen, what happens to my collection?

Weak statelessness and/or state expiry: coming soon (x-post from EthMagicians),"One of the next major challenges for the Ethereum base layer is that  of dealing with the growing state size: currently around 100 GB  including tree nodes and growing by around 50 GB per year. The growing  state is making it increasingly harder to sync the ethereum chain and to  participate as a validator, and risks increasing network centralization  if the state grows, especially if the gas limit is increased further.

There are two main techniques being proposed for how to deal with this problem for the short term:

* **State expiry**: remove state that has not been recently  accessed from the state (think: accessed in the last year), and require  witnesses to revive expired state. This would reduce the state that *everyone* needs to store to a flat \~20-50 GB.
* **Weak statelessness**: only require block proposers to store state, and allow all other nodes to verify blocks statelessly.

Both solutions are well underway in development, and it feels like  around now is the time to switch gear from seeing these ideas as  research problems to seeing them as concrete paths of which at least one  (and perhaps eventually both) need to be implemented into Ethereum.

Question about private key and public address in Ethereum,"Hi.

As we know each private key contains 64 hexadecimal characters - so let's say when I create a private key, then someone other has 1/(16\^64) chances to create same private key.

But each private key is connected with 32 hexadecimal characters' address.

So how it actually works? Does 1 private key is connected with 1 unique address or let's say 1 address can be connected with many private keys? If latter, then someone have 1/(16\^32) chances to create private key which is connected with my address.

Please explain it for me how it works. I know it's a noobish question, but it blows my mind lately.",ethereum,1614467340,mazda7281,2,1,True,2021-02-27

A solution to the erratic supply growth caused by uncle rewards and base fee burning,"I am open to criticism, if you disagree I'd love to hear why.

A proper currency should be a medium of exchange. A way of converting labour into other physical things. That conversion is done through selling the physical result of your labour, or in our traditional system, the direct selling of your labour to employers (I would say the latter is not a good way of doing things, but that's a different conversation). If what you sell is wanted by others, your labour is worth more, if its not wanted, its worth less. You have to do labour that provides value to others.

The currency is what provides the conversion of your labour to other products. This currency should hold the same purchasing power over time. In order for it to work effectively, it should neither inflate nor deflate.

Inflation results in people losing their works value, and in people spending more than they should. That is what we have right now. People are spending more than they can afford and as a result, debt is very high.

Deflation results in people not spending their money. This makes economic growth much harder, as money will not move. Gaining currency becomes increasingly difficult, as very little will want to spend. This means it is harder for people with less currency to be able to satisfy their needs, as they have very little currency to do it with.

Bitcoin, is deflationary. First of all, it has sudden decreases in its emission every 4 years, and the supply will consistently go down due to lost coins, making it less desirable as a currency.

Ether's current emission model would make sense if it wasn't for uncle block rewards and (after EIP 1559 is implemented), base fee burning.

2 is ETH generated every 13 seconds. Assuming that the amount of ether lost per block goes up when the total supply goes up, eventually there will be an equilibrium, where the amount of ETH lost will match the amount lost, resulting in a stable supply. So, the optimal supply growth model of a cryptocurrency should be linear.

Uncle block rewards make the supply growth more erratic. Which brings makes the emission more erratic and less linear. 

Also, now that the base fee is being burned, this will cause more of an erratic supply growth, and possibly deflation. Deflation is not a good thing. Its only a good thing if all you care about is price, and you don't actually plan on using ether as a viable currency.

However, this doesn't mean EIP 1559 and uncle block rewards can't be good. Here is my potential solution:

Instead of giving out the newly minted coins every single block, instead do it every n blocks (n could be 10, 20, 500, etc). Let's set n as 100 for now. So every block gives 2 ETH currently, so let's say the total given out every 100 blocks is 200 ETH.

Now, this amount will be distributed among the miners of every block, and uncle block. Let's say 75% of it is equally distributed among every miner, and 25% is distributed equally among every uncle block miner.

This gets rid of the erratic growth that uncle block rewards introduce.

Now to add the base fee into the equation.

The total amount of ETH burned gets added to the ETH that is distributed among miners.

Because of these changes, the supply growth would be completely linear, making Ether a more viable currency.

Again, I want to hear criticisms of this.",ethereum,1614473734,TheFronkler,10,3,True,2021-02-27

This security approach is just ""game theory"", should a $170 billion dollar crypto network take a security risk, just so a few people make an extra couple % gains? Does the userbase really want to take this gamble? For what other than greed? To fill some DEV EGOS about winning the game?

Brave / Metamask Wallet Issue.,"Hi everyone, 


I have been using the brave wallet for sometime now and I have some comments and issues.


I have multiple addresses saved on the browser wallet. 


When switching between addresses, the currencies sometimes don't automatically update. This means when I switch wallets, the contents of the previous address remain visible. Only after refreshing the page does the new wallet contents load correctly. 


No problem right? 


Except today while using uniswap I somehow managed to get 2 addresses attempting the same transaction (I think). 


Address A tried to perform a swap with uniswap. Transaction status in brave became stuck on pending. The link to etherscan from both brave and uniswap leads to ""Sorry, we are unable to locate this TxnHash"". 


Initially 106 gwei was used. The network appeared calm according to the gas tracker.
 

I also checked the pending section of etherscan and could not find the transaction. 


I then realized the custom nonce number entered would have been the suggested value if address B were used. This is because Address A is brand new and currently recommends a 0 nonce value. 


So I connect uniswap to address B to see if I can still make my swap while A is stuck. To my surprise a pending transaction is already in process. It has the exact values from the stuck transaction performed with address A. The etherscan link also leads to the same ""Sorry, we are unable to locate this TxnHash"" page. 


However, the brave wallet shows that address B has no transaction pending... 


I tried to cancel and speed up cancellation of the original transaction with address A. No success. 


Does anyone have thoughts or suggestions? 


Also, it would be nice if I didn't have to import custom tokens everytime I signed back into the wallet. Address names don't always save either. 

Thanks

Update : Cleared browser cache and reopened uniswap. Address B no longer has the pending transaction! Address A still stuck..

Update 2: Tried a new swap with address B at 115 gwei. Again.. ""Sorry, we are unable to locate this TxnHash"" page.
Another stuck transaction...

Perhaps it's because I am trying to wrap eth into weth? First-time making this swap.

SOLVED: Be sure to know your metamask password, seed and private key string as a precaution. 

Reset each brave/Metamask address under advanced settings.

Clear uniswap history once reconnected.",ethereum,1614392600,xSilentxHawkx,6,3,True,2021-02-26

Why would anyone use ether as a currency?,"Kind of a new to this, could someone help me understand?

Almost everyone is still paid in fiat when they do a job. Everyone wants a stable income, and we have minimum wage laws, taxes, etc all built around this. So it's hard to see companies paying employees in cryptocurrency for the foreseeable future. 

If I want to start using ether to buy and sell things, why would I want to exchange my fiat for ether and pay a fee? And then once I pay a fee to an exchange, I then have to pay to get the ether to my wallet, or to layer 2. There's no way to pay these fees just once - I'll have to keep paying them as long as I get paid in fiat. 

So how does ether become a currency? How would companies start paying employees in ether or another cryptocurrency? How would governments tax crypto income? Why would anyone put up with these huge fees every time they want to buy or sell something?

Even if I have to only pay a small fee to send money to and from my wallet, why would I do that when I can put money in my bank or trading platform for free?",ethereum,1614396893,cheeseHorder,55,14,True,2021-02-26

Ethereum Vs Competitors,"Hi all,

I've been a Bitcoin maximalist for years now and have started warming up to Ethereum. I have a small amount of Ethereum (about 4% of my Crypto at the moment) and would love some opinions on Ethereum Vs. the so called 'competitors' like ADA, DOT, BNB, whatever else is the ""next ETH"". So far, my gut feel is that all these alt coins are trying to copy ETH's main goal (kind of like how a bunch of alt coins tried to copy Bitcoin in the last bull market).

I understand I might get some biased results on this subreddit, but I would love some opinions, links, articles, information, or really anything that I can look into as to why Ethereum is the go to for its purpose. I am currently considering whether to move a larger amount of my Bitcoin into Ethereum, with the hopes of running my own validator one day, and would love as much info as possible.

Thanks in advance!

There are a few current protocol changes that could increase centralization. One is proof of stake, right now it is set at 32 eth, but whose to say that number couldn‚Äôt be jacked up to a absurdly high price far into the future, leaving only a few massive players controlling the network.

How to sell art through NFTs?,"I've been watching the NFT space from afar for about a year now and I have been a longtime holder of ETH. However, from my understanding, every single NFT space so far operates like an exclusive gallery with preselected images by just a few artists. I love some of the art there and I am super happy for those artists, but I myself of course have nothing for sale on any website. I know a ton of other artists who want to get involved in the space and don't know how, but I think at the end of the day we're all tired of giving a 50% cut to every gallery, stock website, or image broker. Is there currently a place where I could make this happen? Sorry if this question comes off as dumb, I know you guys are very serious about ETH here and I feel like this should be a pretty obvious question, but I really haven't figured it out. If I'm being honest, my pea brain can only really comprehend that Ethereum is better than other cryptos and has a ton of awesome functions, but I couldn't begin to tell you how a lot of them work.

Do you think L2 adoption is slow because to end users it's confusing?,"Over the past several days I've been trying to learn the logic behind how plasma, snarks and optimism work. I have a rudimentary idea of how they work now (holy crap the concept of the OVM is interesting). I've been trying out several L2 platforms.

From a user perspective, they're confusing. ZKSwap:

https://zks.app/en/wallet

Is beautiful. Modern looking UI with some nice CSS and a pretty dynamic animated background. But it requires knowledge of how to switch networks in your wallet companion app. It also requires upfront knowledge about *just what is going on* here. Not intimate details around the math behind why zk proofs work, but just some basic understanding (maybe a quick video or flow chart?) of generally what's going to happen to their ETH or tokens here. Typically people are skeptical to use things they don't understand, and so building a UI that guides a user through the steps required of them would probably be a lot less jarring. I don't think most users would feel safe using this app.

A user would land on their app page and have no idea what anything is, and if they stumble around in the menu they'd see a tutorial under More -&gt; Tutorial that's just a (sort of poorly) formatted PDF that's not very user friendly. Next the user has to fiddle around in back menus of metamask to connect to add another network and then connect to it.

Ok I am complaining about zks a lot. Lets check loopring:

https://exchange.loopring.io/swap

now an end user is really confused. Not only is their UI less attractive (sorry, not trying to be a dick, just saying from a user friendly perspective it's more messy) but there's a whole bunch of economic statistics related to AMM being shown here _in addition to_ the L2 mechanics. And also no tutorial.

-----

I think these L2 projects could really benefit from:

1. a better wallet companion app or changes to metamask to make it easier to switch networks. Ideally a website should be able to prompt a wallet companion app to switch to a different network. Wallets should also be louder and clearer as to what network you're connected to.

2. more handholding and cleaner UI on the part of these L2 websites so that regular users can understand them better.",ethereum,1614209468,dont_forget_canada,71,34,True,2021-02-24

Crypto Assets and Taxes - a friendly reminder,"Disclaimer: This is no financial advice, please research the exact regulations applicable to yourself. 

It seems to me that the topic of taxes for crypto assets is rarely discussed. I would even go so far to say that the majority of people trading do not know the first thing about the taxation applicable in their state of residence. This is mostly likely the case because tax law seems to be seen as excessive regulations imposed by a central government agency - therefore, by definition, standing in direct contrast to decentralized networks and trading.

However, in many countries taxes are already applicable when cashing out your crypto-earnings today and with the steady increase in value stricter regulations are sure to come in the near future. Therefore, ignoring this topic can often proof to be perilous.

As for now, taxation throughout the EU is still up to the individual countries (even though uniform taxation will most likely be introduced sooner or later as governments finally begin to understand the true power of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology).

Generally speaking, there are a few things that are important to remember when thinking about trading crypto assets (these seem to be applicable for most countries):

* If taxed, crypto assets usually fall under capital gains tax, income tax, or VAT (upon conversion to fiat currencies).

* This means that crypto assets can attract anywhere from 0-50% tax, depending on how the asset is intended to be used as well as the individual tax bracket one falls into under consideration of earnings from work or other investments.

* These rates mostly apply as soon as you realize your earnings (therefore even when one is just selling coins on an exchange and not leaving them on the exchange/in their wallet for re-investing or in order to cash out at a later time).

* Most importantly: when trading as an individual, there is often a possibility to reduce ones Income Tax liability by offsetting losses against future profits or other income. With some countries tax liability is even cancelled entirely when investing only for the purposes of hodling (no staking!) and not selling it within the first year.

So to my fellow traders (maybe even hodlers?) I say:

Stay informed, when chasing out pay your taxes ( I know it sucks, but its smarter to do it now than to pay even more fines once the government decide to crack down on cryptos in terms of taxation) or, and I would like to stress this option, just keep HODLING!",ethereum,1614133753,AugWhite,14,10,True,2021-02-23

Solution to the Gas Dilemma - Phase 1 &amp; Sharding,"Look, I know there's a lot of FUD right now with gas fees. But I'm just going to tell you right now, I've been in this market and observed this same psychology with Bitcoin last cycle. This eventually led to the ever so dear altseasons where many coins aside from Bitcoin started to explode in value. While this euphoria lasted through the bull market, ultimately these coins bled out and lost all their value versus the dominant pairs (BTC &amp; ETH) and made lower lows in the bear market.....most today that have not fully recovered.

Now today, I'm observing this same behavior with Ethereum and competing networks. These other networks (BNB so recently) have started to gain in value; however what's not being considered is  Phase 1 &amp; Sharding: [https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/shard-chains/](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/shard-chains/)

"Mr Buterik, Increase the Block Gas Limit!","Out of control gas prices, are killing the Ethereum ecosystem. Transaction fees have increased by over 1,000% in the past year. On a USD basis, it‚Äôs even worse at over 15,000%. This is great for miners and entrenched players, but is killing adoption and slowing down the innovation that will be needed for future price appreciation.

/u/vbuterin and the core team are hard at work on long term scaling solutions in Eth2. But that‚Äôs years away. Even EIP-1559 is a minimum of six months. In the meantime, unless the gas costs are addressed, Binance Chain is going to capture a huge amount of the ecosystem. Yes, BSC is far inferior and more centralized. But when you‚Äôre looking at paying $1000 to deploy a smart contract to Ethereum versus $1 for BSC, that‚Äôs a pretty hard to stomach difference. Pancake Swap has already rocketed past all Ethereum based DeFi protocols.

We need relief from transition fees *today*. And there‚Äôs a dead simple solution: increase the block gas limit. It‚Äôs been done many times in the past and even modest increases have always been successful at keeping transaction fees down. It‚Äôs simple supply and demand. Larger blocks mean more room for more transactions mean lower prices. Since DeFi makes demand extremely inelastic, we‚Äôd expect drastically lower gas prices from even incremental block size increases.

The argument against increasing the block gas limit is that it makes the requirements for running a full node higher. But right now, the P2P network is extremely healthy, and the number of synced full nodes has never been higher. Whereas nose bleed gas fees are an existential threat to the project. The majority of full nodes run in the cloud, where provisioning more CPU/memory/bandwidth is literally a push of the button. I‚Äôve forked Geth to run blocks as large as 100 million Gwei, and it‚Äôs easily handleable for a beefy AWS instance. The current block size is 12.5 million Gwei, the network can easily handle doubling it to 25 million. Rough estimate is that this would cut transaction fees by 80-90%.

Please, Ethereum core team. Give the small-time ordinary users relief and increase the block size. You‚Äôve done it before. Eth2 is an elegant long-term scalability solution. But don‚Äôt let it distract you from simple short-term fixes that would immediately boost the health of the project.",ethereum,1613946104,CPlusPlusDeveloper,27,1,True,2021-02-21

Most people including me until recenty have been thinking that the high fees on ETH are crazy uncomfortable right now but it doesn't matter long term as it's being worked on and therefore temporary, it's just a ""pause"" in its utility and all the good times will just resume once it's solved by L2, sharding or POS.

The surge in BNB value is a wake up call, as the OP in the linked thread put it:

&gt; I hate that they are completely CENTRALISED but make themselves seem decentralized. They have complete control over the BNB token. **This is exactly what the crypto community feared and wanted to avoid all along.**

That's exactly right, that's what we feared and should have feared much more as it gets more real every day. Especially because as another poster put it:

&gt; The open market doesn't give a shit about decentralization. If you don't agree, you're actually in the minority. That's why pancakeswap rocketed to #1. That's why Tether is used to this extent. That's why XRP is top 10. That's why exchanges control over 40% of ETH staking.

That quote is frightening, it's frightening because it's true. Majority of people in general, be it traders, devs or users do not care about decentralization. And the more people from general population join the crypto space, the more it becomes the reality for that space.

**That's where lies the very real danger for ETH of, not being attacked from within, but being REPLACED and OVERTAKEN by centralized pseudo-coins and once this happens it might stay that way forever given the above!**

Up until now many thought that ETH is far too ahead to be challenged and we can afford a year or two until scaling solutions are deployed, but **BNB showed otherwise, it got 500% closer in *two weeks*, we *do not have* 2 years to solve this! They repeat this feat just ONCE and ETH is no longer the largest smart contract chain in crypto.**

The fee issue needs to be taken seriously if we want to protect ETH, it's a very real security risk, far bigger at this point than 51% attack, or state growth, uncle rate etc. HALF of Top 10 coins are centralized pseudo-coins, the threat is real not only for ETH but all truly decentralized cryptos. So let's not underestimate it.

We're bleeding developers, users, future innovation right now. I've seen multiple posts and comments about people abandoning ETH leaving for another chain because of the fees. **Once they have this bad experience and invested time and money in another chain, they're not coming back. This is ""invisible"" at first, that guy who left is going to have his project completed and mature in 3-5 years but it will be too late then when we start to see it more openly, it's no stopping it then.**

Also when centralized projects close in or overtake ETH even for a while that's when they're going to take full advantage of their centralized nature. **They're going to be making big bucks which are going to go toward troll farms, media, ""influencers"", armies of paid devs and big institutions are going to buy in as they just LOVE centralization. It's also going to be too late once this becomes apparent.** We might end up rambling about it in an obscure corner of the internet, be ETH fanbois that nobody cares or even knows about - it might seem unimaginable now but once this train gets rolling it might end up exactly like that 5-10 years from now, crypto moves at lightspeed.

If you're thinking that rollups will solve this, think again, L2 is complex and suitable only for a very narrow set of use cases, look at LN on BTC, it totally flopped. Crypto is complex enough, L2 is a level above that and it takes years to make the UX good enough. L2 on ETH breaks composability or makes it complex to the power of 2. **Are we willing to gamble the future of ETH on the hope that L2 gets adopted quickly enough contrary to all experience until now? That carrot has been dangled with SegWit/LN on BTC for years now, let's please not make the same mistake.**

So what am I proposing? As a first step we need to alleviate the pressure *right now*, that can be done ONLY by raising the block gas limit substantially ASAP, at least double it, ideally quadruple it. We've had time for L2, other scaling solutions a year ago, but that ship has sailed, there is no more time.

If you're thinking about the drawbacks of raising the limit, think it in a context of a real threat to ETH security - would it be worth it if there was an imminent threat of a 51% attack? Would it be worth to raise the limit to prevent the attack then? Because that's the situation we're in, just more insidious as the damage caused today is going to show itself only in a few years when there is no longer anything we can do about it.

But I do not think there are any real showstoppers here, uncle rate is at ATL, storage and state growth doesn't matter if we can handle it now as in a few years it will become orders of magnitude easier to handle, for the comuters in 5-10 years it will be just a immaterial blip.

This will buy us time to develop L2 and rollups, which in turn buys us time for sharding and POS but we NEED to kick the can down the road right now as to stop the bleeding.

**Anyway, if you take anything from this write up, even if you disagree with some suggestions, it's that high fees ARE A SERIOUS SECURITY RISK on par with a 51% attack. And it should be taken just as seriously, by the devs and by the users. Beware and be suspicious of people minimizing that risk (in a reasonable way ofc), troll farms may soon be in full swing and the likes of BNB would like nothing more than for us to underestimate this threat.**",ethereum,1613958893,Freedom-Phoenix,398,3,True,2021-02-21
Youtube is completely useless now apparently. Any chance someone could explain the economics behind eth2.0 to me? I swear I tried to do research. Details inside.,"Ok, So I've spent the last few hours watching and reading about sharding, the beacon chain, docking, and all that good stuff about what makes eth2.0 a big deal. Cool, I get it and I'm super on board,  more thoroughput on layer 1 is a good thing. 

What I don't really understand is the economics behind it and what makes this a good thing for those who aren't validators? Like, I have some eth, not nearly enough to run a node, but what about eth2.0 makes the coin worth more or less?

That said, I'm probably just using ETH as a store of value, and considering moving almost everything from my stock portfolio over to crypto and split between ETH and BTC (more into ETH). 
I'd just like to hear opinions from people more knowledgeable about this than me. Is it a good time to do this or is there a correction expected soon? Also, I know this is like asking what the future will be. But is there any kind of expected growth target for 1-2 years? And is ETH expected to grow more than BTC moving forward now?

"Is Ethereum's smart contract infrastructure ""massively overkill""?","I'm not nearly as smart as most of you guys, so, I'd love to get some input on a reply I received recently. Here you go:

""I do agree that PoW should be dealt with and isn't favorable in the long run but Ethereum is a bad example. Ethereum is taking an immense leap with PoS and I hope it proves to be a successful experiment but you also have to remember that Ethereum is at its 2nd hard fork. 

Imo Ethereum is built on bad foundations and the fact we are heading toward a second hard fork proves that.

I don't think there's a need to begin with to have such a complex smart contract infrastructure in the blockchain. The emergence of second layer protocol like Lightning or Liquid kinda support my theory.

There are good functioning experiment of service and websites built in top of the LN like Y'alls, Zapread or Microbet. I'm not affiliated with theses sites, I just found them cool. 

With Taproot activation on our doorstep which further improves Bitcoin smart contract capabilities, I don't think there's anything particularly useful smart contract wise that couldn't be done on a second/third layer protocol.

Ethereum almost feels like having http functionalities on tcp level (thoses are internet protocol). It's just massively overkill and it makes it much harder to build proper abstraction layers.""",ethereum,1613860199,germantree,5,2,True,2021-02-20

Eth2... Such confusions! So concerns! ;),"A bunch of Eth2 questions, from a person who's been out of Ethereum for awhile. Not a newbie to Eth1, but n00b to Eth2..

What even is beacon net, from a practical perspective (I've read the techy description)? Since mainnet is unconnected to it, what does it even do? Especially for a year?

The docking timeline indicates that beacon comes first, then Shards come second, then finally mainnet docking, as its own shard (perhaps a special shard) -- but what even will the predock Shard chains do, if they aren't integrated with mainnet? And I've read it still is unlikely they will even be able to do contracts. So what WILL they be doing for a year+???

It is specified that users stake (minimum) 32 ETH to stake, and then participate on the beacon net (later shards), and get rewarded for doing so with ETH... ETH conjured or supplied how??? And is this reward ETH likewise one-way staked? Or is it granted to the staking user on the mainnet address?

I read lots of talk about mainnet docking... but blockchains like Ethereum are at the end of the day controlled by miners, not by developers. What is the *incentive* for miners to presumably upgrade to dock? If that switches the main chain to PoS then the miners' expensive hashing hardware becomes obsolete--they lose all their investment in that. Conversely, they can only make money on the new net by staking. What if the miners **don't want to dock**? Will this be yet another fork? And what about the smart contracts, now being depended upon globally? ""There can be only one""... It sounds like a minefield--I haven't read anything discussing all this.

For a roadmap, I'm deeply concerned about all the ambiguity and ""options"" in Eth2. For example, right on the ethereum.org page about Eth2, they talk about a variety of options for shards, such as whether they will have state and be able to process contracts, or not, and several others. How can you be barely a year away from a major architectural change to the network, but still debating a wide variety of ""options"" of things to do??? That sounds more like a fantasy story treasure map than a real world roadmap!

How can you shard contracts across chains? It would seem a single contract and all its state would have to live on a single shard. What if one contract makes calls to the API of another? That sounds like a remote procedure call across shards. I'm no expert on any of this, but it seems highly problematic.

I tried finding answers for these questions, but I find the Ethereum documentation to be kind of hard to navigate--I seem to either get stuck in the clouds of fluffy generalities with pretty pictures on the main pages, or taken deep into things like long lists of EIPs or a highly subdivided wiki that makes it hard to connect everything together... (sorry if I just haven't learned how to learn well enough yet...)

How to access Ethereum wallet with JSON keystore file?,"So it has been a while since I looked at Ethereum. I once transferred my Ether from an exchange onto the blockchain itself, for safekeeping. I didn't want to become a victim of one of those exchange hacks.

But how do I now access that Ether on that address? I have all kinds of backups. I used the `geth` tool back in the day to do the transfer. The keystore file should give me access to the Ether again, right? At least, that's what I needed to the transfer in the first place. So it seems to be a solid guess I only need that now again.

Back in the day I had to download the ledger with `geth` to do the transfer, which was then just a few GB. I guess times have changed and it's too big to 'quickly' download it. Is downloading that ledger still needed? The documentation is not really [straightforward](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options).

"Binance, a centralized exchange, is taking total advantage of the absurdly high gas fees. And unfortunately they‚Äôre doing a damn good job of it.","First of all, the entire Binance ecosystem is pretty much all a **copy** of Ethereum's - EVM, gas, smart contracts and Pancakeswap is a fork of Uniswap. Even BSCScan CSS/JavaScript is copied from Etherscan.

Because of the tragic and absurd gas fees on Ethereum, many people have migrated to the Binance SmartChain. This has caused the BNB token to surge by over 500% in the last month and is now the 3rd largest coin by market cap.

I hate that they are completely **CENTRALISED** but make themselves seem decentralized. They have complete control over the BNB token. This is exactly what the crypto community feared and wanted to avoid all along. 

Remember this is the same company that quietly tried to increase ADA withdrawal fees by 400% and then lied about when it got caught. It‚Äôs shady as hell. 

tl;dr - Binance is a centralised exchange with a shady past and it having control of the third largest coin on the market is very concerning for the crypto mission.

what am i buying by exchanging Ethereum?,"hey guys, I keep having this question, that i can not respond. What am i getting when i buy 1 Ethereum?

The ""smart contracts"" tecnology is amazing. the company ideas are amazing.

But i can't understand why would ""Ethereum"" go up or down in price, besides people joining in and buying higher

Bitcoin i can understand, it's finite, it's ""gold"", allows for big moves and tax evasion. Currencyes that are coins and limited, i can understand.

Buying stocks, that go up and down from speculation and company profits, i can understand.

Currencies that are tokens that you burn, i cannot understand.

If i'm getting this correct, when i buy ethereum i'm really just buying a token, called Ether, that is unlimited and is used as a ticket, to make transactions. right?

Right now i have $1k in ethereum, for me it's almost gamble since i can't understand where the money comes from to make it go higher, or why would anyone buy it higher besides FOMO. I put it there because of the fundamentals, just like a stock. But i don't think i'm investing in the company Ethereum. I don't think i'm investing at all, i think i'm just buying a coin, that will be used to buy other stuff.

My disappointing learning experience practicing Ether transactions,"I have a paper wallet sitting at home with a significant amount of ETH on it. I've got a Ledger Nano X on it's way and want to be 100% sure that I know what I'm doing when the time comes to transfer from the paper wallet to the Ledger Nano X. 

To practice, I figured out how to download My Ether Wallet and run the site offline. I generated a new paper wallet using the site and decided that I'd try sending a small amount to it. After funding my new paper wallet I would then generate an offline transaction using the private key, sign it, and then go back online and send the Ether back to an exchange wallet. This way if I messed up I would only have a small amount of Ether hanging in the balance. Like I said before, I just want to make sure I know exactly what I'm doing for when it comes time to transfer my real balance. I did something very similar  a few times just the other day with Litecoin.

So I went on to Coinbase and bought $15 worth of Ethereum. I paid a fee of $1.49 which I expected and am never too happy about but whatevs. I plugged in the receiving address for my new paper wallet and hit send. Boom, this is when the current state of the Ethereum network slapped me in the face. ""$3.71 sent"" displays Coinbase. Oh my God! [I just paid $9.93 to send $3.71"" worth of Ether!](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4d24dfd7da9d75cdacfb181f2a49f160f342137596217e0bd13c31b9b0927c39) That means that if I want to successfully follow through with my experiment I'm going to have to buy $20 worth of Ether on Coinbase, pay $10 to send $10 to my wallet so I can have a balance of $13.71, then spend another $10 to move $3.71 to an exchange wallet. $30 to run an experiment to make sure I have peace of mind when sending a large transaction. Wow! I'm not sure if that's worth it or not lol!

When I was doing this kind of thing with Litecoin I coughed up maybe 8 cents in transaction fees in total to do this on two different paper wallets. I'm not necessarily salty or anything I just wanted to share what happened because it was a very good learning experience for me. I'm not sure if I'm going to follow through with spending $30 to continue practicing transactions. I'm just going to put all of this on hold and hang onto my original paper wallet lol.

"I've thought a lot about defi on a fundamental level, these are my thoughts:","Money is supposed to be a stable placeholder for wealth. Wealth is not a numeric value, it's an abstract concept of goods and services.  Wealth creation is turning a tree into a picnic table, hiring someone to fix your car, knitting a sweater. Increasing money doesn't mean you have more wealth, just ask Venezuela about that.

Investing in stocks creates is a type of borrowing that actually creates wealth, because you are lending your wealth out to a company who uses your wealth to create more wealth. By buying Apple stock, I am giving them money (place holder wealth) to build factories so they can create phones (wealth). 

 Defi does not create wealth as cryptocurrencies are a zero sum game.  Borrowing and lending isn't wealth generation, it's just sloshing the same wealth around between platforms and wallets.  You can farm inflation of an asset, but that isn't wealth generation either, that's just devaluing an asset by increasing the supply. 

Defi has created this interconnected economy that heavily relies on each other, and when new wealth enters in one asset it will likely trickle down into them all. Conversely, when wealth starts to disappear, you would create a liquidity crisis so violent that would make the great depression blush.

&amp;#x200B;

This current defi ecosystem will not replace the traditional system because its  lack of wealth generation makes it too fragile for a liquidity crisis.",ethereum,1613686845,ShotBot,11,1,True,2021-02-18

Can somebody please counter-argue this point regarding governance token vulnerability.,"First and foremost I understand the benefits of a voting system and love the idea of governance tokens. I am just curious about vectors for attack.

Governance tokens are tokens that developers create to allow token holders to help shape the future of a protocol. Governance token holders can influence decisions concerning the project such as proposing or deciding on new feature proposals and even changing the governance system itself.

I want to pose a hypothetical. What would prevent a bad actor/s with disposable capital from buying a controlling amount of governance tokens and then using said tokens to prevent a protocol's innovation. 

Why you may ask? Let's hypothesize that said bad actors own a competing protocol. They buy a large enough quantity of their competitor's governance tokens to prevent said protocol from innovating. This would inevitably lead to that protocol's demise. Less competition, more users for their protocol.

Tokens can be bought by those with the most money. Decision-making power is being given to those who can pay for it. Does this not lead us to inevitably be exploited by the same unfair system we experience today? The few guide the many. This is aristocratic in nature which is strictly against the ideals of a decentralized system.

Is this not an issue?

This thought experiment came to me in part from watching people debate for and against EIP-1559. Those against EIP-1559 seem to care more about profits rather than the health of the network.",ethereum,1613723664,Lfabad,6,1,True,2021-02-19

"An underrated project with valuation $86,400 on the NFT market. x1000 is real?"," 

I found project CyberTime Finance. The team creates the NFT Fantasy League platform. The project documentation says that tokens will be listed on the Uniswap exchange with the following prices:

NFTL - $ 0.001 (total tokens = 86,400,000)

CTF - $ 1 (total tokens = 86,400)

It turns out that at the start of trading, the valuation of both tokens will be $86,400

There will be no pre-sale, IEO. Tokens will be distributed through farming for 7 days. This is very unusual, but interesting for an NFT project. I found the design of their future farming platform. Very similar to the basis.cash concept. They also carried out farming. So, in the first few days, the mcap of the governance token (BCS) reached $500M.

Let's imagine about what might happen to the CyberTime $CTF token during farming:

Price $CTF = 10$ - Market cap - $864,000 - x10

Price $CTF = 100$ - Market cap - $8,640,000 - x100

Price $CTF = 1000$ - Market cap - $86,400,000 - x1000

Who knows, maybe the token will soar and above $100M, but I have little faith in it. And from time to time, the valuation will stabilize in the range of $1M-$10M, until the team releases a full-fledged product. But the fact that on the hype of farming, the estimate can test $30M - $50M and even $80M, I have no doubt. There is a lot of news around the NFT market right now:

The Bull Case for Ethereum (extended),"Hello Ethereans,  

A few weeks ago I posted [A break down of the bull case for Ethereum and how it relates to Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kzkdw4/a_break_down_of_the_bull_case_for_ethereum_and/) on the CC sub. Since then, a few members from the /r/ethfinance sub have assisted me as I continued to work on a complete investment thesis for Ethereum. The original post has gotten the attention of [Bankless](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/), which is in my opinion the best Ethereum related news site that I know of. They will be publishing this thesis (or at least parts of it) once it is complete. Progress has been slow because it has been very hard for me to find time outside of my daily job and family, but I am finally almost finished with it.  At this stage, I would like to ask for help from the Ethereum community to help to polish the thesis, and right any wrongs that I may be mistaken about. I have tried to cover all aspects of the bull case for Ethereum in a way that is accessible to a person with a superficial understanding of cryptocurrencies and economic principles. I am hoping that it could serve as a reference document to assist changing the narrative about the market's understanding of Ethereum.

Constructive criticism will be much appreciated, but no trolls. I also have a google doc open to commenting and I will post a like here if mods are OK with it (if not just PM me and I'll send you a link).

# The Bull Case For Ethereum And How It Compares To Bitcoin 

There is a general understanding among Ethereum investors that the technical enhancements that are currently being implemented will result in a sustainable monetary policy with near 0% issuance and the potential for ether to become a deflationary asset. What is even more interesting is that the net return of ether as a SoV (store of value) becomes superior to bitcoin the moment that issuance is lower than the staking yield. In other words, even if Bitcoin had already ceased issuance, it offers no mechanism to provide yield to long term holders with a negligible risk exposure as Ethereum does. There is an execution risk that Ethereum will not deliver on what is currently planned, but if it does, then it will become more scarce than Bitcoin could ever become under its cryptoeconomic model. However, the focus on scarcity as the primary contributor of value to a monetary asset is arguably misplaced. A dissection of the intrinsic value of money and how it is used can reveal a different story where value is primarily derived from the facilitation of economic activity rather than scarcity. In this regard, Ethereum has a tremendous advantage over Bitcoin because what is often described as ‚ÄúEthereum‚Äôs utility‚Äù is actually the economic activity occurring in its digital domain.

It is impossible to separate BTC/ETH's payment rails from their respective monetary policies. Issuance is just a subsidy, and without it the network will need to operate as a profitable business with a cash flow that is entirely dependent on network fees. For this reason, the revenue collected from fees is the most important metric to determine the sustainability of a non-inflationary monetary policy. Circumstances around Bitcoin that reduce incentives from operating directly on-chain are a potential threat to its security model. We are observing new situations that are causing such degradation of the on-chain utility of the Bitcoin network. The incentive for users to transact directly on the network is being diminished by the tokenization into Ethereum (wrapped Bitcoins) and by the introduction of custodians (like PayPal) and traditional banking services who will soon be entering this space. If these trends continue, I suspect that the only activity that will end-up happening on-chain will be done by whales sporadically transacting to ‚Äúhodle‚Äù and the occasional settlement from institutions.

Bitcoin seems fast and frictionless, but that is only because it is being compared to something in the physical world. In digital terms Bitcoin emulates the friction of operation that is found with gold: it is difficult and expensive to move it, securing it yourself is not trivial, and it does not make for a great medium of exchange. I don't think this will be a good dynamic to generate enough transaction fees. This may be just my subjective interpretation of it, but regarding this particular situation it is nearly impossible to make objective assertions at this point. It is possible to assert that, in the digital world, the expectation of frictionless money would entail near instant transactions with negligible cost and without the relative risk/paranoia of dealing with nuclear waste and having a hacker watching your every move waiting for you to make a mistake to snatch it away. Cryptocurrencies do not offer any mechanism to recover lost funds in case an account gets compromised by a hacker or a mistake is made during a transaction (like keying in the wrong recipient address); this is a serious problem. Digital money would also need to be fully programmable and  interact with other digital assets, preferably defined and operated within the same ecosystem. Ethereum is steaming ahead on all ends.

Ethereum is fostering a digital economy (this is a very important part of understanding the value of ether) with DeFi at its center. It is currently generating about three times as much transaction fee revenue as Bitcoin. Layer 2 solutions are going live as we speak, and it appears that they will be much more practical and provide better UX when compared to the Lightning Network. This will help to amplify Layer 1 block space value and push revenue even higher. That will be followed by EIP-1559, which will help to stabilize fees, improve security related to edge cases, and create a deflationary mechanism through the partial destruction of transaction fees. Mining is currently excessively profitable and the hash rate cannot keep up. This means the financial incentives can be reduced, and by burning transaction fees we achieve the equivalent of an issuance reduction while stabilizing mining revenue. Eventually the transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) will dramatically cut the operational cost of the network. That means that Ethereum as a business will become more profitable and less reliant on the issuance subsidy. Finally, we will see the introduction of sharding which will scale Layer 1 by up to 1,000 times, compounding the effect of Layer 2 solutions and making it feasible for the network to operate as a platform for new use cases. A solution to the hacker/nuclear waste security situation is being explored via social recovery wallets. Social recovery wallets leverage Ethereum‚Äôs programmable capabilities to create a dynamic that is a mixture of self-secured ‚Äúbe your own bank‚Äù cryptocurrencies with the protection advantages offered by the traditional banking system. It is still in the early stages of research and design, but it is important to realize that the Ethereum community recognizes it as a problem and is working on a solution.

# What is Ethereum?

Ethereum and ether are not the same thing. Ether is the name of Ethereum‚Äôs native digital asset. No one can buy Ethereum; when someone says they have Ethereum, what they really have is ether. A simplistic analogy would be to say that Ethereum is to ether what traditional banks are to the dollar. However, it is more appropriate to define what Ethereum is by comparing it to the internet. The internet is nothing else other than a network of computers running a *data* agnostic protocol to exchange *information*. Ethereum is a network of computers running a *value* agnostic protocol to exchange *digital property*. Both sound generic and unimpressive, but society has restructured itself around the internet, and in the next couple of decades Ethereum may have a similar effect upon it. 

The Ethereum network is value agnostic because it allows anyone to create, issue and transact any type of digital asset (not just ether). This is very different from the Bitcoin network because it only allows users to transact its native asset which is also called bitcoin. Bitcoin with a capital B refers to the network, while bitcoin with a lowercase b refers to the asset that can be bought and transacted in the Bitcoin network. 

Ethereum has one more trick that Bitcoin does not have: it allows for users to create and execute computer programs with the same awesome properties that make Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition so compelling: they are inclusive, transparent, trustless, permissionless and censorship resistant; these programs are called ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù.  They are operated autonomously by the network, and they can interact with any digital asset. This opens up a world of possibilities. Amongst one of them the ability to function as a global financial system that is in many ways far superior to the existing traditional financial systems which are siloed, inefficient and prone to questionable administrative practices and fraudulent activity.

In a nutshell, Ethereum reduces the friction of almost any activity that requires trust and/or permission by hosting a fully programmable money and the ability to create an infinite variety of digital assets while achieving a scalable infrastructure with a sustainable net zero issuance monetary policy. These properties make ether the world‚Äôs preeminent monetary asset by a large margin. There is nothing in the world that can be compared to ether with the same network effect of Ethereum. The rise of ether will generate an enormous amount of disruption to all pre-existing forms of reserve and monetary assets - it effectively makes them obsolete. It will suck out the monetary premium from gold, bonds, equities, real estate and eventually Bitcoin.

It may be difficult to see the value of reducing friction caused by trust and/or permission. These are often things we do not think about because they carry hidden costs. Let‚Äôs look at how the traditional banking system is affected by trust and permission. First a banking institution must be given permission to operate by the government. Then, customers must trust the institution and the system as a whole before they desire to open an account. The bank needs to give each individual permission to open the account upon request. Customers must trust the bank management will operate in a manner that does not jeopardize the balance under custody. They must trust that the bank (and consequently the ruling governmental authority) will give them prompt access to their balance while preventing bad actors from accessing private information and/or charging their account without permission. This means that every transaction must be permitted by the bank and the Government. Finally, individuals must also trust that the authorities will administer fiscal and monetary policies effectively to ensure fiat money‚Äôs status as legal tender and that it retains purchasing power. Each individual step adds real costs and operational risks to traditional monetary and financial systems. They are manifested through a multitude of fees, the risk of temporarily/permanently loss of access to balances and the continued devaluation of money through inflationary forces. The inefficiencies of these systems are also reflected directly in the cost of goods and services (payment processors charge vendors, and that cost is transferred to consumers via higher prices).

Bellow is a list of a few other ways that modern society is enduring costs associated with systems that are overly reliant on trust, permission and a lack of transparency:

* Our reliance on communication and social platforms that can arbitrarily dictate who is given permission to use them (Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, Google, etc). We are also entrusting these corporations with our personal data, which can potentially be used/shared without our permission.
* The annual cost of counterfeit products sold on the internet is estimated between $300-600 billions. The total annual cost of counterfeit products is estimated to be approaching $2 trillions. Many of these products are channeled through trusted vendors, and the consumers are unaware they are purchasing counterfeits.
* Financial service providers can arbitrarily choose who/when gets access to their services in order to favor their own interests. This has been manifested by the notorious stonewalling that traditional banks have enacted against cryptocurrency assets, and more recently by the Robinhood-Gamestop scandal.
* The lack of trust in the validity of our electoral process (at least by part of the USA population) has caused social resentment and political instability. Other countries have allegedly violated public trust and produced fraudulent election results.

# What is Ether?

Ethereum (the network) is not trying to be money, but it utilizes ether exclusively for its monetary properties and not because it can be magically burned by an imaginary engine of sorts. It costs money to participate in the network as a miner, and their engagement is financially incentivized with ether. Any activity in the Ethereum network requires the use of block space. Block space is a scarce resource, therefore participants who wish to transact must use ether to bid for it. These interactions are utilizing ether as a monetary medium of exchange. In the long run, as the price of ether goes up, the ether denomination of gas prices goes down. That happens because no one is using ether as gas/oil, and it is actually being used as money. In the short run you may see the opposite occurring because of the dynamic between the portion of block space demand that is inelastic and the increased demand for ether and block space that move in tandem during market cycles.

Why are so many people insisting ether is like oil, but not money? The crypto space has a few analogies that have been used to describe technical/economic mechanisms that are somewhat tricky to understand: mining, Ethereum's gas, and the infamous analogy between ether and oil. Crypto ""mining"" is not like real world mining. It's purpose is not to extract resources, but it is rather a decentralized mechanism to process transactions. Newly minted BTC tokens are not ""mined"", they are minted by the protocol and awarded to operators. Furthermore, it is impossible to change the total mining output of the network... adding/removing miners does not affect the mining output. If you are new to crypto, you can read a more detailed explanation of mining[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/k4qdyc/if_you_are_new_to_crypto_you_may_be_slightly/). ETH's ""gas"" is not like fuel (it cannot even be stored). It is just a computational metric that is more akin to the distance a car must travel, but not what actually makes it move. The fuel is electricity and it must be paid for with ether. When you transact you are also paying for the ""car"" which is the use of all active mining hardware/validators for a fraction of a second. And ether is just money.

To better illustrate why ether is not like oil let‚Äôs imagine I have a car with a 14-gallon fuel tank and I want to take it on a road trip. The car is not aware of the price of gasoline, and it would not travel any farther if the price of gas would double the next day. That‚Äôs because the intrinsic utility of oil has nothing to do with its monetary value. The car needs gas because of its particular physical properties and how the internal combustion engine is designed to utilize it. If I want to drive from point A to point B and it takes a full tank to get there, it will take that full tank no matter what happens to the monetary properties of gas/oil. This is fundamentally different from how Ethereum uses ether.

It is always better to understand the principles of cryptoeconomics than to rely on analogies. If you put too much weight on these simplified analogies, you will not understand the economic actuality behind them. This is a source confusion in the crypto space, and it is used to support false narratives. From an economic perspective, ether is money. Once you understand this, you will know that the narrative that Bitcoin and Ethereum are not competing because they are different things is analogous to saying fax machines do not compete with the internet.

It is important to stress that ether is a natively defined asset, and as such, counterparty risk is eliminated. This is not the case with wrapped Bitcoins and other tokens that are based on assets that require the involvement of a custodian (like tokenized US dollars). This, along with the fact that users need ether to engage in any activity in the Ethereum network (transactions fees can only be paid with ether), makes ether a natural choice to be used as a monetary asset. However, the beautiful thing about ether is that it is actually not ""just money"". It is a mixture of a scarce monetized commodity, money, bond and growth tech stock.

* **Monetized Commodity**: Ether is becoming more scarce and will continue to do so with the transition to Proof of Stake  (PoS) and EIP-1559. Ethereum does not have a supply cap, but it does have a roadmap for a sustainable security model and if it achieves a positive cashflow then it will not only eliminate issuance, it can become deflationary.[ An argument can be made about potential issues with Bitcoin's sustainability in the long run.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/k46gge/the_threat_to_bitcoin_that_no_one_is_talking_about/)
* **Currency**: Ether is used as a unit of account and medium of exchange to pay for every activity in Ethereum. It is also used in the same way for venture capital related to ICOs, and for digital art commercialized via NFTs. Ether is also used as collateral in the DeFi space and new monetary uses will continue to emerge. It is an immature form of digital money, just like Bitcoin is an immature form of digital gold. Some people prefer to say that ether is just a utility token. However, a utility token is just a narrowly scoped form of money. Not only is ether's scope within its digital economy growing, by next year users will be able to pay millions of merchants with ether through Paypal and Visa. We have never seen the adoption of a new form of money grow organically. New forms of money have always been imposed by authorities. What would the organic growth of money look like? It would look like ether.
* **Ethereum's digital economy**: Ethereum has limitless use cases and it is already generating economic activity with real world usefulness. Ether's value will benefit from acting as the native monetary asset for Ethereum. As Ethereum's economic activity grows, the velocity and/or value of ether must also increase.
* **Bond**: With Proof of Stake you need to lock up ether to receive a yield in return. It is similar to how bonds work.
* **Growth Tech Stock**: Ethereum is essentially operating as a cloud based service provider, and the network will be entirely operated by stakers who happen to be the recipients of transaction fees. Ethereum provides a service - that service is paid with ether. The network is controlled by holding ether that is staked. The more valuable the service provided by Ethereum becomes, the more users will be willing to pay for transactions and the more valuable the protocol and the ether token become. It is not exactly the same as holding a stock, but there are a lot of parallels.
* **Full reserve banking model**: This is a bit of a stretch, but it is a potential end-game for Ethereum. It can serve as the base infrastructure and reserve asset for a full reserve banking system. In a nutshell: a consortium of banking companies can be formed to standardize a framework to hold and stake ether under custody in exchange for wrapped Ether (wETH). Customers deposit ether, banks exchange it for wETH, and stake the original ether. Resting balances of wETH on customer accounts can receive a cut of the staking rewards. Banks get their profit model, customers get to spend wETH with traditional banking services and potentially receive a share of the staking yield. Customers could also have access to a yield curve based on variable reserve requirements. This would allow banks to create money (which is actually good for the economy when it is done with moderation), but for the first time ever customers would have the choice of how much risk exposure they are comfortable with. This dynamic could help to establish a form of democratic check and balances system that discourages moral hazard. Ether could become a godsend to banks in the land of negative yields. It's a pipe dream, but not entirely impossible. Don't forget that the US OCC has essentially given banks the green light to take the first steps in this direction (US banks have been approved to use the Ethereum blockchain for their operations AND they can become validators... yup this happened).

# Understanding Cryptocurrency Scarcity

Anyone who is insisting cryptocurrencies are not scarce does not understand how the concept of scarcity works in this asset class. The value of a cryptocurrency is derived from a combination of the code, computers, people and amount of money that is participating in the network. It is the fusion of all these elements that defines scarcity and the impact it has on each unique cryptocurrency. 

I am going to use Bitcoin as an example, but the following concepts apply to all other cryptocurrencies. Computers are used to establish the security of the Bitcoin protocol, and it can be broken down in two distinct categories: the number of distinct nodes, and the mining computational power (known as the network‚Äôs hashrate). Nodes are like messengers that send requests from users to operators and retrieve information back to the users. Nodes do not process transactions, but they ensure the communication between users and operators is undisrupted. It does not cost much money to operate a node, but it is important that nodes exist in large numbers that are independently operated. This is what protects the network from attackers trying to take it offline. 

Operators are the computers responsible for processing transactions, except they are actually called ‚Äúminers‚Äù. Bitcoin uses a clever combination of cryptography, economics and networking to establish a resource intensive mechanism that allows transactions to be processed in a decentralized way while providing financial incentives to participants. Long story short: it is expensive to operate as a miner (miners spend several million dollars every day to participate in the operation of the Bitcoin network). They do it because they are paid by the network with a combination of transaction fees paid by users and newly minted bitcoins created by the protocol. This is what prevents transactions from being reverted and/or censored. At the time of this writing the Bitcoin network has over 10,000 individual nodes, and a total mining computational power that consumes the equivalent of $22 million worth of electricity per day (using the US average electricity cost of 13.19 cents per kilowatt hour). 

When a person buys a bitcoin for the first time, he/she becomes a new member of the network as a participant who can now send and receive bitcoins. What is perhaps even more important, many participants extend their support for the network into the real world by advocating for its value proposition; participating in the Bitcoin network is also a social phenomenon.

Finally, the demand for Bitcoin has an indirect impact in the security capabilities of the network. Miners are partially financed by the issuance of new tokens, which happens at a fixed rate denominated in bitcoins. This means that the higher the price of bitcoin is, the higher the financial remuneration for miners will be. Ultimately this attracts more miners to the network and results in greater protection against the reversal and/or censorship of transactions.

Anyone could copy the Bitcoin code, make slight changes to it and deploy a new crypto called ‚ÄúFunkyDonkeyCoin‚Äù. It would be a worthless network with a single participant, secured by nearly zero computational power.  There is only one reason why anyone would possibly want to buy a donkey token: for the comedic/meme value of having something called FunkyDonkeyCoin because it sounds funny and it uses a picture of a silly looking cross-eyed donkey as its symbol. ‚ÄúDogecoin‚Äù is a real life dog-themed version of FunkyDonkeyCoin. It was created as a joke, but it has surprisingly gained popularity over time and it has reached over $7 billion market capitalization. Most pundits agree that this valuation is not sustainable, but it still speaks volumes about the impact of network effect on cryptocurrencies. The bottom line is that the Bitcoin code can be copied, but the network of computers, people and market valuation cannot.

# Bitcoin vs Ethereum Monetary Policies

One of the aspects central to Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition is its immutable monetary policy, and the determination of a maximum supply cap of 21 million bitcoins. However, the idea that Bitcoin's monetary policy cannot be changed is a myth. It is a false narrative that takes for granted that the issuance subsidy will no longer be necessary at some point, but there is no way to objectively assert this. There is no divine power preventing the monetary policy from being changed. If the security model for Bitcoin was jeopardized because of insufficient cash flow to miners, then Bitcoin's monetary policy would be the first thing on the chopping board to go in order to remedy the situation.

Bitcoin‚Äôs monetary policy has been proven to work very effectively under specific circumstances. Since its inception, the price of Bitcoin has increased exponentially, and up until recently, there was a lack of alternative payment rails that were capable of transacting with bitcoin. Most importantly, Bitcoin has been generally perceived as the strongest (arguably the only institutional grade) store of value asset in the cryptocurrency  market. These dynamics are changing and the sustainability of Bitcoin‚Äôs monetary policy is entering uncharted territory. Sooner or later the price of Bitcoin will no longer double (or more) every four years. When this happens, the issuance subsidy will be effectively reduced on each halving event. Transaction fees will have to fill the gap left by the reduction of issuance, but the incentive to use the Bitcoin network is being reduced by the introduction of so many alternatives systems (wrapped bitcoins on Ethereum, PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, commercial banks and even tech giants like Apple and Google are likely to join the custodial and payment rail crypto party). To make matters worse, Ethereum is starting to be recognized as an institutional grade store of value asset.  It is a mistake to assume these changes will be inconsequential to Bitcoin‚Äôs security model. 

The criticism against Ethereum‚Äôs dynamic monetary policy and ETH 2.0‚Äôs proposed perpetual 1% issuance may seem strong on the surface level, but they crumble once all the pieces of the cryptoeconomic puzzle are put together. For starters, if an argument can be made that the financial incentives to operators (miners/stakers) are excessive or insufficient then an argument can be made for the implementation and execution of a dynamic monetary policy. Additionally, I can‚Äôt see how an arbitrarily picked issuance schedule determined during the genesis of a new highly complex system is likely to be efficient through its lifecycle. Bitcoin's monetary policy provides the certainty of stability and protection from abuse, but it sacrifices the possibility of efficiency and jeopardizes longevity. It would be like if a captain of a ship pointed it in the direction of its final destination, set the throttle, then fell back to his cabin for a nice bottle of chianti and hoped that the ship would arrive safely. There would be no one at the helm to navigate the seas, no one to make sure it stayed on route, no one to avoid the storms or to take advantage of currents. In my opinion it is a pretty bad approach to something as critical as monetary policy.

With respect to how Ethereum is administering its dynamic monetary policy: I don't see any evidence to suggest developers have been enriching their pockets by keeping issuance at current levels. Developers are stakeholders and the Ethereum Foundation holds a lot of ether - debasing ether is against their self interest. There is a great misunderstanding that the ones who are adjusting issuance are the recipients of the new tokens or that they are somehow colluding with miners. Is there any documented case of this happening?

Ultimately, the 1-2% nominal issuance rate of ETH 2.0 must be interpreted as a maximum issuance level; the actual issuance is anticipated to be near zero or potentially negative thanks to EIP-1559, multiple scaling solutions and high demand for Ethereum‚Äôs block space. In the worst case scenario, ETH 2.0 will have a 1-2% issuance rate while providing 2-3% staking yield to long term holders via staking. The market is still skeptical these changes will be executed successfully and/or that they will provide an equivalent level of security to PoW. However, as we approach the full realization of new features, it will become self evident that Ethereum is a superior store of value when compared to any other asset (including Bitcoin).

# Ethereum‚Äôs Bull Market Catalysts

1. **Wide adoption of Layer 2 solutions**: these will amplify the base layer block space value while encouraging further network adoption by a significant reduction of fees. A successful integration with DeFi protocols will dismiss the ""Ethereum killers"" theory and consolidate market confidence.
2. **EIP-1559**: this enhancement involves a new methodology to determine base transaction fees, along with flexible block sizes and transaction fee burning (partial destruction of transaction fees). It will improve security and user experience by stabilizing transaction fees, as well as introduce a deflationary mechanism to ether.
3. **Sharding**: scale Layer 1 bandwidth, compounding the effect of Layer 2 solutions, further consolidating Ethereum's dominance in the DeFi space, making it feasible to introduce new use cases and eventually increase transaction fee revenue.
4. **The switch from PoW to PoS**: discontinuing Proof of Work (PoW) will eliminate the operating costs related to mining and will allow for a reduction of issuance (\~4% will be reduced to \~1%). Money that was previously allocated to buying mining equipment will be redirected to the acquisition of ether. Staking ether will remove it from circulation for extended periods of time. Operating cost will be negligible, allowing validators to withhold most of the ether revenue. This will be the greatest bull market catalyst in the history of cryptocurrencies and it will eclipse the effect of[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=cashtag_click)Bitcoin‚Äôs halvings.

Bitcoin maximalists will be naysaying all the way through and past a market cap flip. Do not get caught up in their narrative. If you are not sure, then it is better to rebalance your portfolio proportionally to market caps. This is a smart risk mitigation strategy that has a huge upside. If none of these enhancements are successfully deployed and Ethereum turns out to be a failure, then you would only have reduced your gains by 20-30%. Otherwise, ETH will be making you mountains of money.

A model for cryptocurrency to compete with banks in the mortgage space. Thoughts?,"As Ethereum now approaches the market cap of JPM, I've been thinking through ways that crypto could compete with more traditional financial institutions. I'm going to focus on the idea of using crypto for a mortgage. Bear in mind that all of this is purely speculative. None of this is financial advice, I'm just posing a hypothetical scenario for how crypto could be used to compete with banks. Here's what I could imagine.

&amp;#x200B;

Goal: Use crypto to finance mortgages to offer more competitive pricing than banks.

Risk: The volatility of crypto poses the biggest risk for something like a 30 year mortgage. Therefore, it's necessary that there's financial instruments used to stabilize or lock in the price of crypto for the underlying mortgage issued.

Risk mitigation: I could see an institution creating crypto mortgages by using [ladder put options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/ladderoption.asp#:~:text=A%20ladder%20option%20is%20an,levels%20before%20the%20option%20expires) over a 30 year mortgage, to ""lock in"" a certain price for the issued mortgage and to protect against downside risk. Obviously this would be complicated to calculate, mortgages and premium purchased would probably be bundled together to average out risk for clients. There would be fees involved, but I could see this being the focus of an institution seeking to compete with pricing offered by banks.

Rates/fees: This kind of product would likely produce variable rate for mortgages, due to premium incurred by purchasing laddered put option contracts. However, in years of upwards price action, rates could shrink to nothing, there could be shared profit between the homebuyer and the issuing financial institution should the underlying currency rise in value, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall this is a very simplistic, hypothetical map of how crypto could be used. Having institutions use instruments to protect against downside risk eliminates, in part, the need for a stable coin. With the total value of all cryptocurrencies exceeding a trillion dollars, I think it's interesting to think through how crypto could be used to compete directly with more traditional financial institutions. In this case, an attempt to offer more competitive pricing for 15 / 30 year mortgages.

&amp;#x200B;

This scenario becomes more likely in a rising interest rate environment. Obviously the fed is now printing like their Xerox, and it'll be a while before the dollar tightens and interest rates rise again. However, the fed's actions seem to be a win / win for crypto. If the fed keeps printing, a capped supply cryptocurrency looks more appealing. If the fed tightens the money supply, and banks start charging more for loans, mortgages, etc. I could see cryptocurrencies used in a way to compete with product offered by banks. If this idea seems unlikely in the United States, it feels more likely in certain parts of the developing world, where currencies and financial instruments can sometimes be dubious.

I'm posting this to help others like me who are just starting out in this crazy world of Crypto in the hopes that even 1 person is saved from being scammed like me.

The scammers cloned his website completely and coupled with the anxiety they created with the time limit which seemed to be quickly whittling down I panicked and led by my stupidity and greed I guess I sent them 1 Ethereum in the hopes of getting 5 or so back.

"This is why EIP 1559 is good- and why Vitalik, developers and most community members support it. If miners have a problem with it, then please argue your case in a livestream with the actual researchers and developers. I'll bring the popcorn.","## What is EIP 1559

EIP 1559 is a proposal to reform the Ethereum fee market, with the following key changes:

* The current gas limit of 10 million is replaced by two values: a &amp;#34;long-term average target&amp;#34; (10 million), and a &amp;#34;hard per-block cap&amp;#34; (20 million)
* There is a BASEFEE (which is burned) which transactions are required to pay, which gets adjusted on a block-by-block basis with the goal of targeting a value so that average block gas usage remains around 10 million.

Essentially, instead of all of the short-term volatility in demand for transaction space within a block translating into volatility in transaction fees, some of the volatility instead translates into volatility in block size.

## Why is EIP 1559 good?

Copying from [an older post](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3473):

-----------------------

There are three major problems with the status quo of transaction fee markets:

* **Mismatch between volatility of transaction fee levels and social cost of transactions**: transaction fees on mature public blockchains, that have enough usage so that blocks are full, tend to be extremely volatile. On Ethereum, minimum fees are typically around 2 gwei (10^9 gwei = 1 ETH), but sometimes go up to 20-50 gwei and have even on one occasion gone up to over 200 gwei: https://etherscan.io/chart/gasprice. This clearly creates many inefficiencies, because it&amp;#39;s absurd to suggest that the cost incurred by the network from accepting one more transaction into a block actually is 100x more when gas prices are 200 gwei than when they are 2 gwei; in both cases, it&amp;#39;s a difference between 8 million gas and 8.02 million gas.
* **Inefficiencies of first price auctions**: see https://ethresear.ch/t/first-and-second-price-auctions-and-improved-transaction-fee-markets/2410 for a detailed writeup. In short, the current approach, where transaction senders publish a transaction with a fee, miners choose the highest-paying transactions, and everyone pays what they bid, is well-known in mechanism design literature to be highly inefficient, and so complex fee estimation algorithms are required, and even these algorithms often end up not working very well, leading to frequent fee overpayment. See also https://blog.bitgo.com/the-challenges-of-bitcoin-transaction-fee-estimation-e47a64a61c72 for a Bitcoin core developer&amp;#39;s description of the challenges involved in fee estimation in the status quo.
* **Instability of blockchains with no block reward**: in the long run, blockchains where there is no issuance (including Bitcoin and Zcash) at present intend to switch to rewarding miners entirely through transaction fees. However, there are [known results](http://randomwalker.info/publications/mining_CCS.pdf) showing that this likely leads to a lot of instability, incentivizing mining &amp;#34;sister blocks&amp;#34; that steal transaction fees, opening up much stronger selfish mining attack vectors, and more. There is at present no good mitigation for this.

EIP 1559 has these benefits:

* It mitigates the economic inefficiencies from social cost mismatch due to fee volatility. There is a fairly nuanced economic argument here; see particularly pages 16-20 of the paper linked in https://ethresear.ch/t/draft-position-paper-on-resource-pricing/2838 (though I recommend reading the whole paper) for a detailed argument of why this is the case. Intuitively, the adjusting fee mechanism works like a fixed fee in the short run and a cap in the long run, and it turns out that because of [arguments from Martin Weitzman&amp;#39;s 1974 paper](https://scholar.harvard.edu/weitzman/files/prices_vs_quantities.pdf) fixed fees are likely better than a cap in the circumstances that basically all public blockchains are in today and will likely continue to be in.
* It replaces the auction with a fixed price sale (except during short periods where blocks fill up completely until fees catch up), eliminating first-price-auction inefficiencies and making fee estimation extremely simple: calculate the fee `f` for the next block, if you can afford it pay it, otherwise don&amp;#39;t.
* It creates a mechanism similar to a permanent block reward (the 1/N coming from the pot), mitigating many of the instability issues with fee-only blockchains without requiring actual permanent issuance.

-----------------------

Another underrated benefit of EIP 1559 is that it makes gas prices _securely measurable_. Today, just looking at gas prices on chain and using them as an index is exploitable, because miners could include either very-low-fee or very-high-fee dummy transactions where the fee would go to themselves. But under EIP 1559, the BASEFEE can only be manipulated at high cost, as dummy transactions would requre even the miner to pay fees (that get burned).

## Are current fee markets really that inefficient?

Yes. The difference between average gasprice and 10th percentile gasprice in a regular block is something like 3x for median and 5-8x for mean. People needlessly overpay massively.

Everyone who does not overpay suffers a delay of 1-2 minutes or even longer, and this delay does not actually benefit anyone; the total load to the chain is the same regardless of whether a given unit of load hits the chain at time N or time N + 60. **There is no actual social benefit from participants &amp;#34;expressing a low time preference&amp;#34;** in the fee market mechanism, at least under normal conditions; it is pure deadweight loss. We would all be better off if more transactions were just included immediately, which EIP 1559 allows.

## Why not just use a second price(or kth price auction) to solve the first-price-auction inefficiencies?

Kth-price auctions (where everyone pays a gasprice equal to the lowest gasprice that was included in the block) are indeed &amp;#34;efficient&amp;#34; in a traditional economic analysis*, but have the flaw that they are vulnerable to collusion.

&amp;lt;small&amp;gt; \* Yes of course technically you want to use the _highest gasprice not included_ in the block; but in practice given that most ethereum blocks have hundreds of transactions the difference would be negligible.&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;

## Might EIP 1559 run the risk of over-stressing nodes and miners during periods of high usage?

EIP 1559 can at most increase block size by 2x, even in the short term. Each &amp;#34;full block&amp;#34; (ie. a block whose gas is 2x the TARGET) increases the BASEFEE by 1.125x, so a series of constant full blocks will increase the gas price by a factor of 10 every ~20 blocks (~4.3 min on average). Hence, periods of heavy on-chain load will not realistically last longer than ~5 minutes.

Note that currently, periods of double load that last 5 minutes already happen by random chance roughly once per ~63888 blocks (~10 days) because of variance in the rate of block production. So the introduction of EIP 1559 would not bring in any unprecedented level of load to the system.

Additionally, the gas limit being only 10 million and not higher is justified to a large extent not by hard network limits (uncle rates are [near historic lows](https://etherscan.io/chart/uncles), though risks to non-miner nodes such as bootstrap nodes, may be higher), but by concerns that are fundamentally long-term in character:

* Centralization risk of somewhat higher uncle rates: if uncle rates shoot up to 20%, that would disproportionately benefit well-connected large pools
* Limits to state size
* Difficulty of syncing after a short period offline

In all three of these cases, what matters is not the upper bound on capacity within a very short window of time, but rather the long-term average capacity. Uncle rates being 2% during odd hours and 18% during even hours would have the same effect on all three of the above, as uncle rates always being 10%. Because EIP 1559 still bounds the long-run gas usage to a ~10 million per block average, it does not affect the long-term average.

## How would a spike of high usage look like under EIP 1559 compared to the status quo?

Consider a &amp;#34;mathematically ideal spike&amp;#34; (eg. this could happen in real life because of a sudden market event leading to many arbitrage opportunities on DEXes, bidding on liquidated CDPs, etc), where N * 10 million gas worth of transactions, each with a very very high gasprice, are all broadcasted.

Currently, this would lead to the following situation:

* The next N blocks are filled exclusively with new spiky transactions
* After that other transactions, as well as transactions that people send after the spike, get included in descending order of gasprice

An average &amp;#34;normal user&amp;#34; would have to wait more than N blocks.

Now, consider the situation under EIP 1559:

* The next N/2 blocks are filled exclusively with new spiky transactions, each with twice the normal amount of gas
* If all other transactions get sent with a gas price cap equal to the old gasprice, then the next N/2 blocks would be empty, and after that things would revert to normal. But realistically, higher-priority transactions would set higher gas price caps and get included first, and other transactions later.

An average &amp;#34;normal user&amp;#34; would have to wait somewhere between N/2 and more than N blocks.

Hence, even including the post-spike &amp;#34;recovery period&amp;#34; during which block capacity would be smaller than normal, most transactions get included sooner.

Here&amp;#39;s a very rough simulation (there are lots of strange assumptions here, but modeling a full system that covers both supply/demand curves *and* waiting times is hard); spreadsheet source [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iid0PnO5UTMECW2RylVwEOECFbW5iWsJSHmP4zj7Lr4/edit?usp=sharing).

## What would EIP 1559 do under larger and more prolonged spikes (eg. day-long spikes)

Not much. The BASEFEE would rise and there would be a short period at the beginning where a few transactions get in faster, but after that the fee market would function just as it would under &amp;#34;ordinary&amp;#34; conditions, just at a higher fee level. The main benefit of EIP 1559 in spikes is that the harms from inefficiency of regular fee markets are magnified when fees are high, so having a functioning fee market becomes more important.

## If the chain _can_ handle 2x block size spikes, doesn&amp;#39;t that mean the chain can handle just making _all_ blocks 2x larger?

No. See this post for why:

https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/eip_1559_spikes

## Why limit = target * 2? Why not 4? Or 8?

It could easily be higher than 2. The higher the limit/target ratio the greater the fee market efficiency benefits of EIP 1559. It depends on how  severe the short term spikes are that we are willing to accept; 2x is fairly conservative. We could even launch EIP 1559 with a limit/target of 2 to start off, and increase it over time as we see the network functioning okay even under short-term spikes.

## Why would miners include transactions at all?

The EIP includes a &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; that transaction senders can include, that goes to the miner. The tip has two functions: first, if there are suddenly far more transactions than expected, miners will include transactions with higher tips first, so the fee-based prioritization mechanism exists as a backup. Second, it compensates miners for uncle risk (the increased risk their block will not be included in the main chain because adding one more transaction will slow it down).

The tip level that compensates for uncle risk has been calculated to be about 0.8 gwei (uncle blocks get on average a 1.67 ETH reward instead of the 2 ETH base, so that&amp;#39;s a ~0.33 ETH = 330m gwei loss, 10 million gas blocks add ~0.025 to the uncle rate ckompared to empty blocks, so the expected cost of 1 gas is = 330m / 10m * 0.025 = 0.825 gwei) and miners do actually set about this value when the chain is empty.

This tip level is independent of the BASEFEE, so client implementations can confidently set 1-1.5 gwei and expect their transactions to be accepted.

## How might wallets choose tips? Is there a risk of bidding wars for tips?

Wallets could simply choose tips by looking at what tips have been accepted on chain historically, and increasing their tip if they see that a transaction they send was not accepted immediately. Note that in &amp;#34;normal conditions&amp;#34; there is no incentive to set a tip higher than the bare minimum.

In cases of sudden congestion, tips _do_ degrade into a bidding war; wallets can detect congestion, and in this case they could offer users the option of setting low or high priority for their transaction.

## What is the escalator mechanism? How might the escalator mechanism be combined with EIP 1559?

The escalator mechanism is a different proposed transaction fee reform, where instead of specifying a single fee, users specify their fee as a function, usually with a beginning, an increase-per-block and a maximum, for example &amp;#34;5 gwei if this transaction is included in block 10123456, add 1 gwei for every block after that (eg. 8 gwei if included in block 10123459), up to a maximum of 100 gwei&amp;#34;.

This would be four parameters: beginning fee, beginning block, per-block increment, max fee.

The goal is to be &amp;#34;safer&amp;#34; against mistakes in fee estimation, as if the fee turns out to be too low it would naturally rise over time until the transaction is included. In an EIP 1559 context, this could be used to set the tip. The fact that the tip would generally be in a constant range means that even a wallet using fixed parameters for the escalator would deliver reasonably good outcomes to users.

## Won&amp;#39;t miners have the incentive to collude to push down the BASEFEE by making all their blocks less than half full?

In general, the effectiveness of such strategies is limited, because unless truly almost everyone colludes, a transaction not included in one block will get included will just get included in the next block and so the effect of this action on the long-run BASEFEE will be negligible.

However, what miners _can_ do is a kind of &amp;#34;monopoly pricing&amp;#34;. Suppose transaction senders are willing to pay some extra fee to avoid getting delayed one block. Miners can refuse to include transactions that do not include some minimum tip `T`; they lose out on some fee revenue, but gain from senders increasing their fees if they value the extra probability you will be the next miner and include their transaction highly enough. This strategy is heavily tilted against the miner: they suffer the full cost of lost fee revenue, but gain only a small portion of the increased transaction fees that others send.

Note that even if a miner using such a strategy is successful, they will increase other miners&amp;#39; revenue more than it will increase their own revenue (as other miners free-ride on the higher tips due to your actions), so it is not a centralization vector.

This will _not_ reduce BASEFEEs down to zero; rather, it will hit an equilibrium where BASEFEEs remain the bulk of the fee and tips take up the remainder. This is because unless miners are all colluding (in which case we have bigger problems), miners suffer the entire cost of not including transactions but gain only some of the benefit of tips being higher.

**If the risk of miners deploying such a strategy is _still_ deemed unacceptably high, we can direct some (eg. 50%) of the revenue from EIP 1559 into a pool from which a small percentage is drained every block to be added to the miners&amp;#39; block reward**; this ensures miners benefit from the BASEFEE being high, further reducing the gains from such an attack.

Here is a proposed sketch of a change to the EIP to do this:

* Define the account 0x35 as `FEE_SMOOTHING_BUFFER`, and define `FEE_SMOOTHING_CONSTANT = 8192`
* Add an additional term to the block reward (added at the same time as the base block reward and uncle+nephew rewards). Let `smoothing_reward = FEE_SMOOTHING_BUFFER.balance // FEE_SMOOTHING_CONSTANT`. Transfer `smoothing_reward` wei from `FEE_SMOOTHING_BUFFER` to `block.coinbase`
* After applying the block rewards, 1/2 of EIP-1559 fees from that block (rounding down) get added to `FEE_SMOOTHING_BUFFER`&amp;#39;s balance. The remainder (ie. 1/2 rounding up) gets burned.

Note that in a proof of stake context, it would be desirable to implement secret leader elections along with penalties for early revelation, to prevent validators from acquiring reputations as only accepting high tips and gaining the entire benefit of this themselves as transaction senders would know which validators are creating blocks soon.

I'm fascinated by the world of Defi lending/borrowing. My portfolio is almost exclusively Defi. I'm trying to learn everything about it.

I understand the concepts and advantages to LENDING on platforms like AAVE. But I'd like to understand why someone would borrow? I get the concept of borrowing to move into other coin positions.

But let me lay out an example that confuses me:

AAVE says borrowers most frequently borrow for ""unexpected emergencies.""

So lets say Jimmy needs 6000 bucks for an emergency. He has a bit more than 6000 bucks in ETH. Let's say ETH is at 2k and he borrows 3 ETH to be 6,000USD. He has to pay back 3 ETH +interest, right? So no matter where the price is, he's paying 3 ETH. Whether 3 ETH is 2k a coin or 10k a coin.

So where is the advantage? You're losing 3ETH whether it's from your current stash or if you buy more ETH to cover it.

Help me understand how ETH can succeed despite being mutable,"I don't understand how ETH has survived, given how the community chose to handle the DAO. Ethereum is supposed to allow for smart contracts, effectively making code law. Yet, when the law wasn't what the community wanted (since the law cost most of the community money), they retroactively changed the code to benefit themselves. 

What is the point of smart contracts that can be undone if people don't like the outcome? Why even use Ethereum at that point? The whole thing is just a mess and it astonishes me that the community has just conveniently forgotten about it over the years. I've been in this space for almost 10 years now so I've been accused before of fixating on old news, but this is the kind of problem I don't believe ever goes away.

In any case, this is not an attack on Ethereum, I have never been a part of the Ethereum community and don't hold much of a stake in it either way. I'm just interested in hearing from people why they feel it doesn't matter.",ethereum,1613368059,danny223,10,1,True,2021-02-14

But, still, I'd like an opensource wallet-only for ETH.

Further reading about the Ethereum platform and ETH, I want to have ETH assets, too, and maybe LTC. 

But I'm torn on what wallet to use. I just want to hodl, then start transacting in decades time(when I definitely will have a HW wallet).

I don't plan on trading assets. Just buy(via P2Ps) into my wallet and hodl, till I get a HW wallet to transfer the assets to.

The round closes as soon as the last ticket is sold.

1. Should the bet size be fixed (say 0.1 eth)? Or, should it be configurable by the creator with a minimum?

[Question] How do smart contracts get verified with physical goods?,"I've been reading up on it, but don't really understand it.

Here's an example I found on some website:


&gt; **Let‚Äôs imagine that John wants to buy Mike‚Äôs house. This agreement is formed on the Ethereum blockchain using a smart contract. This smart contract contains an agreement between John and Mike.
&gt; 
&gt; In the simplest terms, the agreement will look like this: ‚ÄúWHEN John pays Mike 300 Ether, THEN John will receive ownership of the house‚Äù.**

how does this even get verified? You can't put a physical item on the blockchain. Even if it's a secret password to unlock some vault to get the deed to the house, what's to prevent somebody from promising a bad key on the contract or not even having the deed in the vault?

For example:

1. I pretend you can have my house and write the contract that if you give me $500 worth of ETH you can have it
2. Second person puts $500 into the smart contract
3. Second person clicks buttons saying ""OK I put in 200 and verify there's a house that OP put up"". I click button saying ""OK sure I put up a house, whatever""
4. Smart contract completes, other guy is screwed out of $500 because I'm not giving him my house, I just lied

Even if this happens, crypto isn't currently something that would hold up in a court of law right? And the lawyer fees to go through this kind of mess would be dumb to even do in the first place. What am I missing here?",ethereum,1613004219,ausum_possum,25,2,True,2021-02-10

Proposal for a better side bar,"Hello everyone,

As someone who has and continues to recognized the immense possibilities of Ethereum, ETH, and the future of the internet, the more I recognize the need for an ""all-in-one"" center of information for people of all disciplines and walks of life, to educate themselves on the multi-disciplinary world that is Ethereum and Crypto.

Ethereum.org is an excellent place to start, and is FULL of educational content, but much of the info on the site requires the reader to continue their education elsewhere. This requires more time, effort, and the possibility of digesting biased and bad information. What I am proposing is an ongoing, workable, list of resources, that cover everything from ""Ethereum Basics"" to advanced topics on coding, philosophy, and economics.

If we are going to push this technology forward and change the world (as is the mission), we need a library of resources that can help all backgrounds catch up and achieve whatever it is their goals are in this space. We also need this information to be easily accessible and user friendly. This information should be organized much like a college course, prospectus and all. Gate-keeping should not be tolerated. We should encourage all backgrounds and levels of education to get involved.

Admittedly, I am writing to you after my 3rd beer, so these thoughts may come off as jumbled, unorganized, and inarticulate, but my hope is to start a conversation on how we can make the mission of Ethereum, the economics of Ethereum, and the technical aspects of Ethereum more accessible to a broad audience.

And i think we start with an improved side-bar where users can easily learn everything from the most basic to the most complex. Thank you for reading, lets start a convo and continue to improve the future for everyone.

TLDR; let‚Äôs work together to make a better sidebar for the noob to the PhD",ethereum,1613008226,Redivivusllama,8,9,True,2021-02-10

Security flaws of PoS?,"Hi all, I've got a few questions that I'm hoping to find answers for:

From my understanding of the scalability problem: 
&gt;as a blockchain scales, the number of transactions per second a node needs to process increases which translates into increasing costs of running a node. Higher and higher costs lead to less and less participants who can afford to run a node, incentivizing them to pool together, raising the risk of centralization to unacceptable levels.

The understood way to avoid this is to: 
&gt;Keep the costs of running a node trivially small compared to a participant‚Äôs profit/income

What I don't understand is:

1. Is sharding just a temporary solution? Splitting a blockchain into multiple smaller blockchains, thereby reducing the costs of running a node, will only be a temporary solution as shards will inevitable scale...?

2. How does the shift to PoS help at all? The real world already shows us that when people can compound their wealth without risk (e.g. land ownership), the rich gets richer, poor gets poorer, and it tends to a pareto distribution (i.e. centralization)??

3. PoS + DeFi has been highlighted by researchers to create a chaotic feedback loop which makes the decentralization/security model very unclear... based on profit maximization, whether the rational participant stakes his coins, or loans it out via some DeFi app is purely dependent on price. This means that the amount of staked coins can fluctuate.. leading to high risk of centralization. This does not happen with PoW because it is decoupled from the price 

4. Is PoS not very suspectible to state actors covertly taking over? It seems to me that governments like the US will not conceed the domainance of the USD that lightly.. 

5. Why are we witnessing a wide-spread abandoning PoW? It seems to me that PoW is by far the best for decentralization?? You need to actually risk your investment (mining costs) in order to stand a chance of gaining rewards...",ethereum,1613037212,BeyondGodlikeBot,9,1,True,2021-02-11

Interview between Raul Paul and Lyn Alden about Ethereum,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dul7G-dVTic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dul7G-dVTic)

&amp;#x200B;

The video is segmented by topics.

Lyn is hesitant when it comes to investing in ETH...  I personally don't think she has a strong grasp of the layers of the ETH ecco systems are...  but that aside, there is a topic about EIP 1559 in which even Lyn Alden feels EIP 1559 would be one of the *most* beneficial elements implemented in ETH.

Coming from someone (Lyn) who is hesitant about ETH's future and at the same time saying it's the most promising aspect of ETH this year, one must question why there are people who don't want EIP implemented.  It's a very small groups but ETH is open to listen to what they have to say at the end of Feb. anyhow...

Let's also consider there are 100's of millions being staked by investors that knew staking and EIP 1559 would be implemented.  Stakers are locked in.  We can't remove ourselves from the network. Minors can anytime they want.  This is a factor that miners don't seem to appreciate...  Miners can come and go validators and stakers have a one way ticket...  That's called conviction and should be considered when implementing EIP 1559.  This is why we invested in the project to begin with...  Both have profit motives but only one is taking on the risk and that matters!

So in the end, it appears even those who (Lyn) are lukewarm about ETH feel EIP 1559 needs to be implemented.  These  are some of the most respected macro and financial advisors in crypto to date.

Raoul Pal is amazing and has an excellent perspective on the ETH and I attribute this to his experience due to macro investing for decades.  Experience matters.

I¬¥m not sure if I want to buy BTC for this price anymore. I see much more potential now in ETH and Cardano because of the percentage profits and price being actually still low now.

But dont owning BTC feels so weird to Me and my crypto plan was based only on BTC earlier...But I dont see that I can make a big money with BTC anymore. I¬¥m not big investor in crypto, I dont have thousands of USD to buy a lot of BTC, but I can buy some nice portion of ETH and ADA...

What would You do? Rather invest in ETH and other alts and dont own a BTC or do You think that not having BTC is a mistake? Is there anybody who doesnt own bitcoin?

Idea for Alternative to PoW and PoS - Training AI,"Hi there,  

I've had an idea in my head and I wanted to share it to see if it had any validity or not.  

Currently proof-of-work is the most popular form of validation, but it results in a NEGATIVE impact because energy is being wasted on cracking meaningless algorithms, which is why cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum are moving to proof-of-stake. 

Proof-of-Stake has a mostly NEUTRAL impact because energy is not being wasted, but nothing is gained from the validation process other than possibly promoting liquidity in the market. 

I was thinking of a POSITIVE impact that could come out of the validation process. What if instead of cracking algorithms, the proof-of-work system transitioned to minimizing loss functions in training AI, or optimized some other metric in the training process like accuracy, which would act as the validation. This would enable AI researchers and developers to train models without fronting the costs that exist today, and give them much more computing power. This would progress the AI industry forward an exceptional amount. 

Let me know if anything like this is remotely possible or if I fundamentally lack understanding. Feel free to take the idea further if you see any hope in it.

How to define L2? (Let's decide on a proper definition),"There are many solutions out there that claim to be Ethereum's L2. Some rightfully, but some are just using that claim for marketing purposes.

I think we should develop a proper definition of what L2 is to counter those sketchy marketing tactics.

I think an L2 should tick the following three boxes:

1. It has a 2-way bridge with L1.
2. It depends on L1 and cannot exist without it (but not vice versa, L1 does not depend on L2).
3. It derives security from L1 (fully or partially).

Fitness/Wellness Software on Ethereum?,"Hello, I‚Äòm newbie that blew in with the retail investor/doge hype and have been spending a lot of time researching Ethereum. I‚Äôm currently having a blast and really wish I got into this sooner. 

My question is about the existence of Fitness/Wellness software built on Ethereum, like a MindBody or WellnessLiving equivalent. I haven‚Äôt found anything yet. If it doesn‚Äôt exist, I really think it could be disruptive in the best way possible. I own a dance studio, and the software my business uses allows clients to sign up for classes, purchase sessions and packages, book appointments, etc. Some limited marketing and reminder tools as well as a calendar/schedule feature. It‚Äôs already kinda clunky, but the worst thing is that the software teams with a third party merchant processor, and it‚Äôs a damn racket. Large compliance fees and a significant cut of profits every month. Can‚Äôt go with any other merchant processor because this is the only integrated option. 

I‚Äôve been daydreaming about putting our business onto a crypto-powered solution but my customer demographic and industry isn‚Äôt necessarily about early adoption. That being said, I wanted to see if folks could give feedback on this idea and if the front end could be developed so customers without ETH with virtually no experience with crypto currencies could use it successfully. Finally, I‚Äôd like to hear about dapp projects (if any) that might be similar or could be leveraged for this kind of thing.",ethereum,1612854903,LizardCleric,0,1,True,2021-02-08

"Rationale: you are given 12k, do you get 25% of 1 BTC or 7 Ethereums?","A bit of a (hopefully fun) hypothetical that could spark some deep discussion. Let's say you have about 12k set aside. 


This equates to roughly 25% of 1 bitcoin at a current market price of $45,000. 


Or, 7 Ethereums at roughly $1,600.


Lets say you are ok with not touching the money for a long time, say 10 years. But at the same time, wouldn't be opposed to exiting the market in 2-3 years and taking profit if there is sizable gains in that quick 1-3 years time.


What would your thought process and and rationale in the decision of picking 7 Ethereums or 25% of a Bitcoin?


As with most things in life, the answer is usually the middle ground, but since this is a hypnotical, if you were pressed to make a binary decision between these 2 choices, which would you go?

"Newb questions about ETH, Transactional Logic Question","Hi All,

I am a newb and been running through YouTube videos but I‚Äôm having a hard time understanding a portion of the basics but I think I‚Äôve got it narrowed down to a few questions and was hoping someone could answer for me. 

I‚Äôm trying to understand how transactions are actually executed/computed and how gas cost is computed. 

The actual transaction and programming logic is contained within an ethereum (ETH coin?) and when it gets sent to the block chain the actual computers/nodes validating the transactions are actually executing the programming logic against their own computing resources and then recording it to their own ledger?

Do the nodes go under a lot of stress computing really complex programming logic? 

How is gas computed? Does the logic difficulty cause the gas price to go up, if so how does someone know how much gas to charge before executing complex logic?

I‚Äôm sure my questions are riddled with fundamental misunderstandings and I really appreciate the help.",ethereum,1612746344,ideal2545,8,1,True,2021-02-07

Newbie question: Gas cost for transferring ETH to another wallet?,"Hello,

I'm fairly new to ETH and crypto in general; just stepped in after years of sidelining (and beating myself up over it). 

I started buying on LiteBit which has its own wallet system, but since then I've found another exchange (which also provides a wallet) with much lower fees, staking support, etc. I want to transfer my ETH but reading about the gas cost makes me hesitate. It is only a small amount  (&lt;$100)  and I am reading stories about relatively huge costs, especially for lower amounts. 

Should I transfer and if so, what kind of gas fee can I expect? Or should I just let the ETH sit in the original exchange for the foreseeable future?

"To all the newcomers in this space, welcome!","Whether you entered the crypto world during the Gamestop saga, or when Elon Musk tweeted about Doge, or when Tesla invested 1.5 billion dollars in Bitcoin, welcome.

Avoid FUD and FOMO like the bloody plague. Do your own due diligence, do not follow the hype and educate yourself on the movement as a whole, rather than how to make as much money as possible, the shortest period of time conceivable. 

Start by only investing what you can afford to lose. Choose an exchange that is trusted (there are many nightmare stories to be shared from those who have been here for years). Binance ([https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=JN2IBGLC](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=JN2IBGLC)) is the largest crypto exchange out there and is probably the most trusted.

Do not tell people how much you have invested. That information is on a need to know basis and they do not need to know, nor does anyone on some online forum. If you share too much, you will be targeted by certain individuals with nefarious intentions. A sensible level of caution is advised when operating in the crypto world. Keep your wits about you.

Finally, never ever be put off by obnoxious know it alls - ASK! ASK! ASK! It does not matter how silly you may feel your question is, you will find an army of open and generous people here who are more than willing to take the time to explain anything and everything to you.

Block reward decrease discussion,"Since 2020 January price has increased by 15x while hashrate only have increased by 2.5x meaning a 6x increase in return to miners just from the block reward. 
On top of the block reward miners are now paid on average in January 2021 an extra ~1.35 ETH in fees per mined block compared to in Jan 2020 when fees were basically 0.

This meaning rewards paid per block is up 10x from a year ago, with that said I'm mainly interested in having a discussion but from my own point of view I think a 25% decrease to 1.5 ETH per block is fair.

I feel like now is the time to bring this discussion to light with the Berlin hardfork around the corner.

Token Bonding Curves + Liquidity Providing + Std Governance Module = Decentralized and Democratic On-Chain Hedge Fund,"Hey there Ethereum Community!  


I'm a cryptographer and Solidity developer and I love hacking around with DeFi and doing different smart contract projects in my spare time. I was inspired by all this commotion over the stonk market recently and it gave me some ideas that I tried to apply into some smart contracts. Basically when Chamath Palihapitiya tweeted:  


\`\`\`r/wallstreetbets is now the largest hedge fund in the world.   Excepts it‚Äôs completely decentralized and entirely democratic.\`\`\`  


I felt challenged to create the real thing: a truly decentralized and community managed Hedge Fund DAO on the ethereum blockchain. If you want to jump right to the code, you can check it out here: [https://github.com/superarius/pooled-compound-lp](https://github.com/superarius/pooled-compound-lp)  


None of the ideas here are original at all, it's really just taking a bunch of existing ideas and mashing them all together, and probably it's covering tracks that have already been covered. However I'm not sure that we've seen DeFi in exactly this flavor before so I want to present it to the community for some feedback:  


To cover the model I was going for really briefly:   


Token Bonding Curves / Continuous Tokens: Everything centers around a Continuous Token bonded to a specified asset on some specified Bonding Curve. Basically anyone can mint and burn the Gov token, but the price is a direct function of the current circulating supply. If a lot of tokens have been minted when you send a transaction to mint tokens you'll get a smaller allocation of the Gov token for e.g. 1 DAI or e.g. 1 ETH than you would if you mint the token at some other time when the circulating supply is less. The price and supply are eternally fixed in this relationship and there is guaranteed liquidity from the Gov token into the collateral token, though the amount of collateral received and profit/loss made depends on how the supply differs from when you mint and when you burn the tokens. To put it simply the bonding curve makes it so that early money gets a discount. It also creates a primary market with automatic price discovery for the token and the collateral asset. Setting a ""Reserve Ratio"" or ""Connector Weight"" of 0 on the bonding curve essentially bonds the curve 1:1 with the collateral asset at a fixed price. (This could be a nice and fair model as well, i.e. if the collateral is a stablecoin every dollar invested gets the same participation in DAO governance and rewards as any other). Ok thats Token Bonding Curves, briefly.  


Lending to Compound: Here's where it gets a bit more interesting. In standard Token Bonding Curve the collateral just sits there in the contract (it is ""collateral"" after all). However in our case the (let's say DAI though it works just as well for any other Compound Finance asset) collateral is immediately lent to Compound and the contract holds cDai while tracking the amount of DAI collateral it has received from token holders. This way we can have the standard economics of a Token Bonding Curve but also generate interest. That interest could be divided among token holders or governed over arbitrarily by them. There is also COMP accruing just for providing liquidity which can also be governed over by the community. This is particularly interesting because you basically create like a ""Province"" inside the Compound Finance ""Country"" and that province has it's own process for deciding where it will allocate the COMP votes, something vaguely similar to the Electoral College. Finally there is the OPTION (though I showcase both ways) to allow Hedging Bets on the deposited collateral. Now this creates risks of losses and insolvency (like Melvin Capital is having :)) but also shows the potential possibilities of the idea. The community can control the Bonded Token contract (which is the contract actually lending all the collateral to compound) and could be permitted to do Borrowing off of the asset which is already being lent to Compound. In this way the community could in theory short and long different compound markets all through smart contracts and governance voting on proposals for price points to sell at and targets to hit etc. They could act as a full fledged crypto hedge fund.  


Governance Module: I basically just forked uniswap governance (which was already a fork of Compound's governance). By making the governance module the ""Owner"" of the Bonded Token contract you get the properties described above which makes it possible to collectively control the community position in the compound markets.  


Now this is only a sketch and there are a number of possible concerns and potential flaws or security risks in the idea. And of course a number of parameters to tweak and play with (the shape of the curve, the quorums needed for governance actions etc. etc.). There's also the very important questions of privacy and speed which are both difficult to achieve with DAO governance and quite important when it comes to trading (it needs to be able to avoid gross manipulation since investment actions are publicly scheduled). And finally there are legal risks which I'm pretty interested in (or I would have already thrown something up on mainnet). I'm not trying to do anything illegal, but I'm also this isn't some scam, I'm hoping to start some community driven fully decentralized little experiment and see if it works or grows.

Ethereum is not trying to be a shark, or a bird, or any other concrete immutable thing for that matter. Ethereum is a shapeshifter. It is the shark hunting for prey in the deep ocean, and the eagle ruling the skies. Ethereum is many things at the same time - it was designed to be this way. It is a value agnostic network just like the internet is a data agnostic network. Michael also suggested that ETH 2.0 is a ‚Äútotally different beast‚Äù, and that he would have to wait for that to come out to have an opinion about it. Again, this is evidence that he does not understand Ethereum and what the 2.0 upgrade is all about.

Build and protect cities - train and march units - buy and sell your land while all the players race against a rising sea level and control of the Victory territory.

  
The RR token is live on mainnet first so it can get some distribution before the mainnet season 0 and first staking period starts. Stakers take home 10% of the total eth spent in-game, while 90% goes to the victors.

Good luck on the battlefield!

How a DAO could take the GME case to a different level," While it may rather seem to be a post for r/ethtrader, this is a post in which I try to make the case for how a DAO could supercharge what [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) did with GME: a collaborative attack on a billion Dollar hedgefund.

I didn't know wallstreetbets before the short squeeze of the GameStop stock and as many people I had to read into what was actually happening. Skimming through media reports the narrative seemed to be plain and simple ""Reddit rascals tricking Wallstreet suits"". However, if you follow the topic closely on Reddit, you can clearly see that for some people including [u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/) (I highly recommend to check out this post on [r/video](https://www.reddit.com/r/video/) featuring his original analysis) this was neither a get-rich-quick scheme nor some joke. People really liked the idea to have the hedgefunds by the balls.

I personally don't think that this sentiment will eventually last (although I hope to be proved wrong). There may be even more people on the Subreddit claiming to hold with diamond hands, however overall there is a lack of proof that people DID hold, contributing to an increasing lack of trust - because people don't know for sure what the majority plans to do or is already doing, people lose the ability to act as a collective.

Now, dealing with a lack of trust even in an environment where people are highly suspicious of each other is somewhat the core feature of cryptocurrencies. A DAO that is able to buy stocks based on the vote of a group of people would allow investors to not only join forces but also to effectively eradicate the prisoners' dilemma that GME stock holders currently experience. This provides retail users with unprecedented powers.

Of course, joining forces is possible for everyone, retail users and bankers - but the wallstreetbets case shows that in the end a viral social media movement can be pretty powerful, at least relatively. The people who would join forces by adding funds to a DAO gain mutual trust and the ability to share risk, but they likewise share the gains and by doing so reduce them heavily. This makes it much less attractive for those who are mainly interested in multiplying investments short-term - people with a political agenda (flip the bird to Wallstreet) won't see this as a problem..

What would be needed is a DAO with a bridge to the stock market. Not as easy, but still possible in the very near future. I am half-sure, we might see this of solution within the next year.",ethereum,1612230932,oneawesomewave,40,27,True,2021-02-01

A possible security issue with Proof of Stake,"Let me start off by saying that I am in no way bearish on Ethereum or PoS. I am a big ETH investor and I believe that PoS will be a huge success for Ethereum due to its many benefits over PoW. I even think that long term Ethereum has a big chance of flipping the market cap of Bitcoin.

I have a question about a potential risk with PoS that I have been thinking about.

It goes like this: Let's say we enter a bear market and the ETH price starts dropping rapidly. Because of this, many validators withdraw their staking funds since they want to sell. This causes even more selling pressure due to security FUD and the price just continues to waterfall down.

What prevents this from occuring? I'm sure I am missing something here.

Perhaps due to game theory many people would start staking to protect the security of the network, but in the end I believe most people are selfish and in it for the money and not for the tech.

As a savvy but non-technical evangelist and follower of Ethereum for 4+ years (meaning, I generally ""get it,"" though the technical aspects can fly over my head at times), I don't need an ELI5 on stablecoins. However, I do feel as though I am missing something. Is it as simple as: there will be as many stablecoins as the market demands? That markets love variety, and if these coins offer different savings rates, governance etc., end users will flow toward those where they find value? Or will network effects necessitate a flow toward a single superior coin?

Put another way: (aside from being a crypto purist who is wary of legacy institutions -- sure, a reason in and of itself, but let's put that aside for now) why would one elect to hold Dai over USDC? What about Dai vs. DeFiDollar? Etc. etc.

Something peculiar about discussions on ethereum inflation vs fiat USD inflation rates,A concern some have discussed is that eth inflation is similar to fiat because there is no hard cap so it is inflated on a regular basis. There are a lot of valid reasons why eth inflation is more sustainable than fiat but I realized no one is talking about a major fundamental difference in fiat inflation vs ethereum inflation. When we discuss ether inflation we are using the literal percentage of newly issued coins each year. Inflation rates for USD are not calculated this way and if we did want to compare direct inflation in terms of money printed each year it is wayyy more than 2-3% a year. More like 10-30+% annual increase in base currency for the past decade.

ELI5: How will ERC20 tokens work across shards in Eth2?,"It is my understanding that the ETH1 chaindata state will be 'docked' as a shard in Eth2, lets call that Shard1.   However lets also imagine another shard, Shard2.   

It is clear that an ERC20 token that exists in ETH1 today will work in Shard1, no problem.  However, how will that token be able to be moved from Shard1 to Shard2, and how will Shard2 know how to 'handle' that token?  

In Shard2, will all ERC20 tokens operate the same way with the same interface and no custom code?  For example, will auto-rebalance token's balances like Ampleforth still re-balance in Shard2 even though the Ampleforth token contract only resides in Shard1?   

In my mind, that is an impossibility and tokens like Ampleforth will break after the ETH2 transition since users can simply transfer their tokens to another shard, like Shard2, where they will be immune from rebalancing down.

Adopting XDai Stable Chain as a layer 2 solution,"I have recently been looking in to XDai, and it looks beneficial to Ethereum for use right now. The fees on Ethereum are at a point where if you aren't doing a large buy, then it's worthless to even use dex's such as uniswap, as your ETH gets eaten up by transaction fees. The fees on XDai are much smaller in comparison, will be a traders dream, and it's possible to gain access to them using a dex such as honeyswap.

The problem I see is that it's quite technical to use because of the bridging of your tokens, and difficult to figure out. It's already quite technical using uniswap, so this extra layer adds complexity. This is why there isn't much liquidity on honeyswap.

Can anyone involved with XDai or Ethereum tell me if dapps are being built that will be integrated with wallets such as MEW, to do this bridging of tokens with a few clicks, and then complete honeyswap trades within MEW (as you can with uniswap)? This feature in MEW would be a game changer for liquidity.

*Processing img c56mskr3dhe61...*

YPRO token holders will be able to earn passive returns by depositing and locking up YPRO and LPs tokens to our farms or by staking these tokens. In the future there will be more options to get reward, because we're planning to launch YPro.Governance, YPro.Vaults and YPro.Lending and YPro.Borrow platforms.

 YPRO Token ($YPRO) is the governance token of [YPro.Finance](https://ypro.finance/) platform. Right now we are working on developing and launching three main products - yield farming platform ([YPro.Finance/farm](https://ypro.finance/farm)) - (launch date: 25 February 2021), token staking platform (YPro.Stake) (predicted launch date: Q2 2021) and a protocol for exchanging ERC-20 tokens (YPro.Swap) (predicted launch date: Q2 2021).

**YPro Farm launch information: (Public launch 25 February 2021)**

YPro.Farm platform is nearly completed and will be officialy launch to public on 25 February 2021. (After YPro Token sale)

It is a DeFi App, being technically supported with smart contract YPro Farm Token (YPF).

Anyone holding Uniswap LP tokens can stake those LP tokens into the corresponding initial list of pools. Once done, they will start earning YPF tokens as reward.

The list of eligible LP tokens can be added per on-chain governance.

At every block, 150 YPF tokens will be created. These tokens will be equally distributed to the stakers of each of the supported pools.

**Important!** As the introductory launch offer, the platform will generate 4x more YPF rewards per block (600 YPF) during the first 7 days after launch, divided by the proportional share of the pool. The exception to this will be ‚ÄúYPRO/YPRO‚Äù pool which will have a 4x proportional share as compared to other pools. After 7 days, the reward will be set to 150 YPF per block.

Check short video presenting how our farm works: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIVJLpKWvfI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIVJLpKWvfI%20) (test mode)

We need to get better at promoting Ethereum's brand,"We really need a better way to promote Ethereum's and DeFi's branding, in a similar way to what Bitcoin has been able to achieve.

As part of this initiative, we should all get together and raise $1 mil. for a Twitter branded Emoji similar to Bitcoin's. 
This should be an easy task for Ethereum Foundation + Defi protocols.

From a Coindesk article:
""Twitter charges companies up to $1 million for them to add a branded emoji or symbol after a designated hashtag to help differentiate their branding from that of their competitors, helping to create a buzz amongst consumers.""

A Decentralized Stock Exchange Discussion","A year ago I start production of creating a decentralized stock exchange that would allow people to trade without the median party interfering. I got pretty far in the project but I had to table it to focus on other businesses. But Since now is a better time than any to introduce this, I will offer both the video explaining how it works and the foundational code of this project to hopefully build something for the people. I hope that this can be a community collaboration with this fellow community of developers to weigh in on how they wish this project to progress! If this gets a lot of support we can turn it into a foundation where the people contribute.

GME Trading - Best example of why we need Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs),"If during this whole process of /r/WallStreetBets attacking institutional short-selling assholes is not the best case for for decentralized exchanges (DEX‚Äôs) idk what is. The market making platforms literally halt trading on reddit stocks like GME, AMC, and BB multiple times during the trading session making it so you cannot trade the way you want. This usually happens when the short sellers trigger a huge sell off, and you bet your ass they have a mainline that‚Äôs directly plugged into the NYSE that is going to let them get out of their short positions faster than you can put your buy positions through so that they can mitigate their losses. Now we also have all these different banking platforms putting restrictions on your ability to buy and sell these stocks, the highest volume stocks ever, while having multiple platforms also crash or become unusable without them having to take any responsibility whatsoever (even though they seem to love taking those transaction fees). Nothing about this whole thing is transparent. DEX‚Äôs are coming, and while in their current form they are not there yet they will be especially when we add layer 2 solutions or get into phase 2.

Need a little help,"Good day to all!

First of all, I want to say that until recently I did not want to ask for any help, but I can not cope on my own

My name is Mikhail, I'm from Russia. I live in a small village near St. Petersburg. At the very beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, I suffered from this disease in a severe form.

During the last year, I have been helping COVID-19 patients in my spare time. There are many elderly people living in my village and neighboring villages. There are a lot of cases of the disease, and often the disease is difficult.

Many of these people do not have money for medicines, as they do not have the opportunity to come to the hospital. Local hospitals have few cars, doctors also do not have time to go around all the patients.

I spend my free time and money helping the elderly. I take them to the hospital, I take the doctors from the local hospital to the patients ' homes, and sometimes I use my own money to buy medicines for people.

In general, I can do it, but there is one problem. I have an old diesel car with a lot of fuel consumption, and I have to spend a lot of money on trips. I'm trying to swap my car for the cheapest electric car, like the Nissan Leaf. But the amount from the sale of my car is not enough to buy it, and taking into account all my expenses, I can not save the necessary amount. The money is small, after the sale of my car, I will only need about 2 thousand dollars.

The cost of electricity is such that trips in an electric car will cost about 10 times cheaper than in my car. This would allow us to do our job more efficiently and allocate more funds for medicines.

Since I am located in Russia, the easiest way to accept donations is BTC or ETH.

If someone reads this post and wants to help a little, I will be very grateful.

If someone donates at least $ 1, then together you can be of great help to a large number of people.

Here are my wallets:

BTC:  1Ghm3SpKx7tgbjJ8VhecqTECXxvhFT8f1d

ETH:  0xe36A1BcFBDAd97232973B522f87bebC09BCd1f47

&amp;#x200B;

I'll say it again. I'm ashamed to ask for help and I'm trying to cope on my own. But my capabilities are unfortunately not enough. I will be very grateful if someone responds and helps a little. Thanks for your attention!",ethereum,1611843864,Mike_Russian,0,1,True,2021-01-28

Ceramic Network: Clay Testnet is officially live!,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/8j33kzjl2xd61.gif

&amp;#x200B;

**After more than a year of hard work, the Ceramic team is excited to officially unveil the Ceramic Clay Testnet.** Starting today you can experiment, prototype, and develop applications on top of the [**Ceramic protocol**](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic).

Keep in mind, the Clay network is *experimental*  and should only be used for prototyping, development, and testing  purposes. It's great for getting your application ready for mainnet  (scheduled for late Q1 or early Q2 2021).

For  those new to the technology, Ceramic is a public, permissionless,  censorship-resistant network for managing mutable information on the  open internet. By combining a stack of cutting-edge web3 technologies  including IPFS, libp2p, blockchain, DIDs, and authenticated  (signed/encrypted) data standards, Ceramic gives developers the ability  to build completely serverless applications using dynamic, verifiable,  decentralized data. Ceramic can be used with any blockchain and currently supports Ethereum, Filecoin, Cosmos, EOS, with Polkadot and others coming soon.

Along with this announcement, [**IDX**](https://idx.xyz/),  a protocol for cross-platform decentralized identity and interoperable  user data built on top of Ceramic has entered beta. The IDX SDK is a  useful tool for adding decentralized identity functionality to your  already existing application, and is an easy entry point to get started  with Ceramic. IDX currently runs on the Clay testnet, so it has the same  guarantees as Ceramic and will move to production when mainnet  launches.

\--

To learn more about the Clay testnet, read the [**official announcement**](https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/) or our [**twitter thread**](https://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork/status/1354448316512284675?s=20).

To get started, try the [**demo app**](https://playground.ceramic.dev/) and jump into the [**docs**](https://developers.ceramic.network/build/quick-start/).",ethereum,1611771863,oed_,0,2,True,2021-01-27

Reddit announces partnership with the Ethereum Foundation,"Hello, Ethereum world!

Reddit admin [u/jarins](https://www.reddit.com/u/jarins/) here, with some exciting news to share today: Reddit has teamed up with the Ethereum Foundation to establish Reddit‚Äôs first-ever blockchain partnership!

As Reddit continues to grow with more than 50 million daily users and hundreds of thousands of communities, the platform has long maintained a decentralized ethos by empowering users to create, govern, and grow their own communities. Through this partnership, we will be increasing our commitment to blockchain, accelerating scaling and resources for the Ethereum ecosystem, and bringing the value and independence of blockchain technology to millions of redditors.

In many ways, this collaboration started with the [Scaling Bake-Off](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/) that we hosted in this community with the Ethereum Foundation. In this new stage of our partnership, immediate efforts will be focused on bringing Ethereum to Reddit-scale production. Our intention is to help accelerate the progress being made on scaling and develop the technology needed to launch large-scale applications like Community Points on Ethereum. The scaling technology developed through this partnership will be open-sourced and publicly available for anyone to use.

We introduced [Community Points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/) last year to give more ownership and control back to users through decentralized technology. Built on Ethereum, Community Points represent a user‚Äôs ownership in a community and rewards them for their individual contributions (such as posts and comments). This project is our first attempt at utilizing decentralized technology to empower individuals to have a sense of accountability and more ownership in the communities that they create and contribute to. Community Points are currently in beta on the Rinkeby network and are being tested in [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) and [r/FortNiteBR](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/).

Our blockchain efforts will be led by Reddit's Crypto team (hi!). We are currently [hiring](https://boards.greenhouse.io/reddit/jobs/2419120) great backend engineers who want to build the decentralized Internet. If you‚Äôre interested in solving tough problems like scaling and bringing blockchain to millions of users, send me a PM or apply directly on Reddit‚Äôs careers page -- we‚Äôd love to talk to you!

We‚Äôre looking forward to working closely with the Ethereum Foundation, and contributing more to the broader Ethereum ecosystem -- and we hope to share some exciting announcements over the next few months. I'll be hanging around with a couple of folks from the Ethereum Foundation to answer questions. Ask away!",ethereum,1611774902,jarins,896,1095,True,2021-01-27

Fortunately, they‚Äôre now on Alpha and they‚Äôre seeking for some Alpha testers. Here are some details:

Mechanics:

* There are a limited number of rocks, papers, and collectible cards. They have various levels of durability ‚Äî with single-use being the most common.
* The goal is to collect the most stars by defeating opponents
* Cards and stars can be traded
* In-game wagering with your stars, cards and digital assets are allowed
* The time period for a season is limited

They‚Äôre still developing the game to conduct tournaments in the future. Coming soon to Ethereum Network's Solidity, Tron Network, iOS, Android, and Samsung App Store.

YPRO Token ($YPRO) is the governance token of [YPro.Finance](https://ypro.finance/) platform. Right now we are working on developing and launching three main products - yield farming platform ([YPro.Finance/farm](https://ypro.finance/farm)) - (launch date: 25 February 2021), token staking platform (YPro.Stake) (predicted launch date: Q2 2021) and a protocol for exchanging ERC-20 tokens (YPro.Swap) (predicted launch date: Q2 2021).

   
 

**YPro Farm launch information: (Public launch 25 February 2021)**

YPro.Farm platform is nearly completed and will be officialy launch to public on 25 February 2021. (After YPro Token sale)

It is a DeFi App, being technically supported with smart contract YPro Farm Token (YPF).

Anyone holding Uniswap LP tokens can stake those LP tokens into the corresponding initial list of pools. Once done, they will start earning YPF tokens as reward.

The list of eligible LP tokens can be added per on-chain governance.

At every block, 150 YPF tokens will be created. These tokens will be equally distributed to the stakers of each of the supported pools.

   
 

**Important!** As the introductory launch offer, the platform will generate 4x more YPF rewards per block (600 YPF) during the first 7 days after launch, divided by the proportional share of the pool. The exception to this will be ‚ÄúYPRO/YPRO‚Äù pool which will have a 4x proportional share as compared to other pools. After 7 days, the reward will be set to 150 YPF per block.

I have some concerns about Ethereum which i haven't seen many people cover yet.,"This post is about fees but not about the current gas price. This is a concern I have about L2s. 

Before I start I feel obligated to say I'm not recommending any ghost chains here, I just want to discuss something i've been a little worried about.

Right now the gas price goes up when people are willing to pay a higher gwei to get their transaction to go through and the gas price drops when less people are willing to pay the current price. This is classic supply and demand.

My concern is that once L2s become popular, the gas prices on L1 could increase exponentially.

Let's say market limit on how much people are willing to pay for gas is 500 gwei for example, L2's like optimism allow people to pay 1/150 of the L1 gas price. So the gas price on L1 could be 1000 gwei, while the price on optimism is still 6 gwei. 

We could run into a situation where the market within L2s are pumping their gas price up to 50/100/500 gwei, making the gas price on L1..

50 gwei in L2 = 7500 gwei on L1

100 gwei in L2 = 15,000 gwei on L1

500 gwei in L2 =  75,000 gwei on L1

This would make it virtually impossible for 99% of people to deposit into a L2 because the deposit is an L1 transaction.

TLDR; L2's offering 150 times cheaper gas prices could make L1 gas price pump to insane heights.

I understand Ethereum phase 1 would massively help remove this issue as L2s will have 62 times more head space thanks to being able to store data on Eth 2 chain. This certainly isn't a long term issue, just something I'm concerned about if Uniswap, snx and chainlink suddenly gain loads of users on L2 before phase 1.",ethereum,1611678004,Oxygenjacket,0,1,True,2021-01-26

Your keys but not your ERC-20 tokens,"""Centre"" (Coinbase+Circle) blacklisted an ETH address containing USDC ERC-20 tokens.

&amp;#x200B;

So obviously this is not decentralization at work and seen that it's not ""your keys, your keys"", I've got a few questions...

&amp;#x200B;

But first some background: here on etherscan if you ""click to see more"", you can see that some ""blacklist(address investor)""...

&amp;#x200B;

[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x15cbde1b9bf285db50e22eeff1a7d04ea267dd94726df8ecabdb4cb6c2b590cb](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x15cbde1b9bf285db50e22eeff1a7d04ea267dd94726df8ecabdb4cb6c2b590cb)

&amp;#x200B;

USDC on ETH is an ERC-20 token right?

&amp;#x200B;

Can all ERC-20 tokens be blacklisted at will by the centralized authority who issued them, or only USDC?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a legit person, who invested very early in crypto and made serious bank. I'm no gangster. I don't sell drugs. Should one of my ETH address with SHITLOADS of USDC get frozen, is it possible to get Centre to unlock it (say after lawyer'ing up and winning)?

&amp;#x200B;

I read somewhere that when ETH 2.0 comes, ETH itself shall become some sort of token inside the Ethereum blockchain. Is that correct? Will that new ""ETH as a token"" that we'll ALL be owning be ""your keys / your coins"" or is there going to be some ""blacklist(...)"" function call that can block any ETH address?",ethereum,1611444866,straightOuttaCrypto,13,1,True,2021-01-23
Passions Network's network of 260+ Niche Online Dating Sites is now accepting payment via Ethereum and Bitcoin,"This forum is directly responsible for our company setting up a payment option using Coinbase as the cryptocurrency payment processor. 

After reading (here) about another company running payments through Coinbase, we set everything up in a matter of hours. (We had no idea it was so easy or we would have done this a year ago.)

While individual sites within our network of dating sites are free, there is a one-time-only 'Network Wide' upgrade fee to access the entire network of sites. While this has been the case for years, we only just now expanded the payment options to include ETH and/or BTC. 

Our guess is that most online dating sites will begin accepting cryptocurrency payments in the very near future. If they don't, they just don't understand it.

How Polkadot project StaFi brings liquidity to staked assets like DOT and ETH2,"Massive amounts of capital are locked in staked crypto assets. But a relatively new platform is making those markets both tradeable and liquid.

Enter StaFi

StaFi, founded in 2020 and built on¬†Polkadot, is among the first-ever decentralized protocols that help unlock the liquidity of staked assets via its own platform. This means users can stake their¬†proof of stake¬†(PoS) tokens (which are untradable until they are staked) and get a ‚ÄúrToken‚Äù (reward-Token) in return.

These rTokens enable users to¬†both¬†get the staking reward and trade the locked staking token at the same time. ‚ÄúYou can stake your PoS tokens through Staking Contracts built by StaFi,‚Äù the team said in a post, adding:

‚ÄúAll you have to do is use the tools to stake your PoS tokens, and you‚Äôll receive rToken in return which can be exchanged and traded on DEXes and CEXes in the near future, as well as integrated in other DeFi protocols.‚Äù

StaFi developers had earlier launched rETH, a solution to the liquidity of ETH2.0 staking, with the help of community contributors. This opened the gates for the¬†nearly $3.3 billion locked¬†in ETH 2.0 to be tokenized, liquified, and traded.

PSA to Newbies coming into Ethereum and Bitcoin: Don‚Äôt buy from any exchange that doesn‚Äôt allow you to actually withdraw your coin,"##The Problem

I‚Äôm seeing a big influx of new users asking questions about where to buy their first bitcoin or ethereum and how to store it. I didn‚Äôt realize this before, but mega corps such as PayPal, Robinhood, and Wealthsimple do not allow their users to actually withdraw their crypto to their own wallet. You only have the option to buy and sell the coin on their platform. This is terrible for the community and not at all what cryptocurrency is all about. These companies are basically creating gated communities where they are profiting from pure speculation, and is detrimental because if you buy on these platforms you will never have the ability to actually hold your own coins. You will end up in the same place which spurred satoshi tried to avoid which is having an entity or a government that can take away everything you own at any moment. They are also creating a system where they are taking your money to buy more BTC/ETH but they never have to sell their holdings. 

##So if you are new, where do you buy your BTC/ETH?
This question is going to be heavily dependent on what part of the world you are from. If you are about to post this type of question, please include which country you are from and what currency you want to buy in.

##What wallet do I withdraw to?
The community consensus for long term holding is hardware wallets. The most popular ones are Ledger and Trezor which are both multi-coin wallets. ONLY ever buy directly from these websites, and never from resellers as they could potentially have been tampered with. If spending extra money is out of the question for you, then consider looking into generating a wallet with virtual machine that is not connected to the internet. I‚Äôm not as familiar with this method of wallet generation so I‚Äôll let more informed people chime in on this. Alternatively, the least secure way out of the bunch would be to use an extension wallet like Metamask or MyEtherWallet. 

*Ledger have previous had a data breach where their customers information was leaked to the web. The hardware wallets themselves are still secure, but Google the circumstances of this to make your own informed decision on whether or not you want to continue using this wallet.*

##I have questions, and I need help!
We understand that crypto is hard, and there are a barrage of information, traps, and scams out there on the internet, but it‚Äôs very difficult to help you when you don‚Äôt provide adequate information. You are much more likely to get support from the community if you are more specific with your question and provide as much details as possible *(never under any circumstance post your private key or 12/24 mnemonic key online while asking for help.)*",ethereum,1611504772,Psychedelic_Traveler,13,1,True,2021-01-24

Question from a noob / beginner,"So, I have a home/gaming computer with a 3090 and hi-efficiency PSU that doesn't get used for 3/4 of the day, and power is pretty cheap in Vancouver so I thought I would try and understand what mining is all about.

Starting with Ethereum (need to start somewhere), and getting about 110mh/s out of the box, I was wondering if people could provide context if/what/why it might make sense for me to do this, or does it make more sense to take a gamble on a crypto that is still in the pennies (or something really low) so if there is a chance that it explodes, you might make a bit of money?

I realize that I only have one rig and this is recreational for me - does it make sense to keep my rig grinding away in the background. Right now with the watercooling and not excessive o/c'ing the rig the GPU hovers around 40-45c so I am not creating an excessive amount of heat (might be a bit of an issue once summer comes a long).

So its really about the question from a recreational strategy - should I just try and mine a specific coin, should I use NiceHash (and as i understand it, basically rent out my GPU for the best profit at the time based on what NiceHash calculates), should I pick a rando relatively unknown and new coin just for shoots and giggles?

All in all, this is a fun learning experience so am thankful for any constructive insight, feedback, suggestions etc.",ethereum,1611533140,Cynikill,1,1,True,2021-01-24
Ethereum valuation models,"Hi all and happy Sunday. I've been reading and learning more about some of the Bitcoin valuation models like Stock-to-Flow and the updated Stock-to-Flow X approaches. The conversation of their validity notwithstanding, are there any valuation models that have been done for Ethereum? Any that are promising?

I saw this post:  [(1) I calculated Ethereum's Stock-to-Flow value : ethfinance (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gld5d5/i_calculated_ethereums_stocktoflow_value/)  as well as this one:  [Stock To Flow - Santiment Community Insights](https://insights.santiment.net/read/stock-to-flow-617). 

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any other models that are more pertinent to ETH? Could Stock-to-Flow even be as valid for Ethereum as it is for Bitcoin? What differences would there be between the model for ETH as well as for ETH 2.0 and other phases?

Any guidance on where to start looking is appreciated.",ethereum,1611533309,WhatATimeToBe_Alive_,0,1,True,2021-01-24

Are DeFi governance tokens just money grabs?,"I get BTC... I get ETH... I even get XRP and DOGE... but one thing that I do not get is governance tokens with hundreds of millions to billions of dollars of market cap.

Could somebody please explain to me why somebody would want to trade their assets for governance tokens, or support selling/trading of governance tokens?

I suppose you could buy up over 50% of the tokens and then vote to transfer all assets on the platform to your own personal wallet.

Other than that, I just do not understand what other rationale there is for governance tokens, other than being issued in the first place to make their founders money by selling control of the project to the highest bidder.

It just seems risky/questionable to me to create tokens specifically for governance that require no financial interest on the platform itself and can allow entities with unknown and potentially nefarious intentions to assume control of the project.

The only way for a project to truly be decentralized would be to make the project immutable. Selling governance rights opens the door to the complete opposite.",ethereum,1611539417,RepresentativeSalt82,0,1,True,2021-01-24

SERIOUS QUESTION: How Do I Import Ethereum private key to a wallet without the QR code/how to fix mist white screen on windows 8.1?,"Hey everyone, so i have a question and have been looking everywhere but cant seem to find an answer. I have seen people with similar issues relating to thei bitcoin, but no one seems to be dealing with eth. 

So i pulled up my old laptop, and tried to open up my ethereum core/mist wallet but am met with a blank white screen. (Not allowed to add the image for some reason...)

However, i saved the private key in a text file and have access to the key and nemonic but without the qr code. I also have the keystore file but since im having issues opening the actual wallet, i cant even transfer it (drag and drop) into mist. I get an error saying please manually install geth 1.8.23 (which i did) but the screen remains blank. I even tried reinstalling the whole wallet altogether, but at this point i really would rather just use a web based wallet. Its going to take so much space and time to synchronize the blocks anyways. 

So my question to you all is: 

1. Is there a way to fix the blank screen issue (On windows 8.1) 

2. Can i transfer my keystore to a usb and try installing the wallet on a different computer and then drag and drop the key store in there (or even to an online wallet such as blockchain or coinbase, etc.) 

3. Is there a wallet or app that i can use to transfer my ethereum directly by inputting the private key manually? (literally by typing in the private key address)¬† I should also mention that there is a chance that there are seperate alt coins attached to this address, but i honestly am not sure since its over 3 years old. 

That's essentially all, im so curious to see how much ether i have in this wallet and it's driving me nuts not being able to check!

"The security level of PoW networks should be measure in dollars, and it should reflect the cost of executing a 51% attack.","Equating hashrates  to network security is yet another huge false narrative in the crypto space that needs to be debunked. PoW works as a resource intensive activity. Its security is a function of the aggregated cost of mining equipment depreciation and operation. The purpose of PoW is to allow for a decentralized operation of the network. This consensus mechanism is effective at achieving this as long as no single entity controls 51% or more of the processing power of the network. The perpetrator evaluates the feasibility and profitability of the attack by calculating how much it would cost to successfully execute it. Hashrates are a factor of this calculation, but what really matters is the $ cost. This is why hash rate is a not a good security metric. This results in two main implications:

* It is impossible to compare BTC's with ETH's security level by looking at hashrates alone because each uses a different hash function with dramatically different costs.
* Mining hardware becomes more efficient and cheaper over time, this means that the hash rate of a network must go up in order to maintain the same level of security over time.

Trying to Understand Ethereum 2.0 Issues and Risks,"I am trying to understand Ethereum 2.0 better at a high level.   As I understand it (so far) the new protocol will use ""staking"" instead of proof of work.   In staking, you put 32 ethereum into a validator, and you are either rewarded or punished with additional/fewer ethereum for your actions.

Questions:

1) What will happen eventually if they need N validators for the new network, but the available ethereum that want to participate in that scheme vastly exceeds the required number of validators?   Will the new entrants be put into a queue?   Will the network round-robin participation between every validator that wants to participate?  Are such things even decided yet?   

2) If you want to participate as a validator on the new network, that effectively means you will be running your own server and will be constantly under hacking attacks trying to steal away your money?  What are the main security threats you need to protect against?

3) If you buy ETH today, are you fully guaranteed in having your money be portable to the new network?   Do you need to run your ETH 1 coins through some process to officially convert them over to ETH 2, and is that process reversible?   

4) What would be the main arguments for and against starting to participate in ETH 2 today?

5) Has the phase 0 started, and if not when will that happen?   What is the projected timeframe for phase 1?",ethereum,1611215921,smorgasmic,13,1,True,2021-01-20

Poster to Learn ‚Äî The Value of Ethereum-Eip1559 Proposal,"&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 0wgnyhbwbnc61...*

**An Innovation in the Gas Rate Market / Burning Concept**

In the current Ethereum system, new transactions need to be packaged by a miner to enter the next block. A higher gasPrice can also encourage miners to package transactions. A rational miner always wants to package the transaction that carries the largest transaction fee. During the peak period, the gas cost becomes unpredictable or even uncontrollable.

**EIP-1559 Ethereum Improvement Proposal**

The proposal, first made by Vitalik in 2018, aims to reduce transaction fees by introducing fixed rates and a burning mechanism, thereby making the dynamics of the Ethereum blockchain fee more predictable and alleviating congestion.

**EIP-1559, a Predictable Market Rate**

The basefee will dynamically adjust so that the total gas used in a single block approaches the limit of 10 million gas. Instead of going into miners‚Äô pockets, the basefee will be burned.

To incentivize miners to package transactions, users can also set Tip, a parameter of the maximum amount that users are willing to pay when a transaction is packaged into the block. In the end, miners will receive the tip.

The basefee does not fluctuate drastically on changes in network demand, and alleviates the inefficiency in the past ‚Äúbidding‚Äù model (which is what the tip follows), making the gas fee more predictable.

**EIP-1559 Burning Mechanism**

The burning mechanism promoted by EIP-1559 (the destruction of the basefee) establishes the dominance of ETH in the Ethereum ecosystem, provides a deflation mechanism for the supply of ETH, and makes tokens scarce and secured in the long run. All these will benefit ETH holders as a result.",ethereum,1611217701,ViaBTC,23,1,True,2021-01-21

MSI Radeon Rx 5700XT Gaming X Afterburner/Mining settings.," 

Hello guys, this is barely my second post on the subject so please be kind.

Im interested in starting the journey of mining, and after some info i found out that the card i bought for gaming is one of the best possible cards for mining as well!

So i wanted to ask, what is the BEST possible settings in afterburner/radeon centre, and in general, so i get the highest hash speed WITHOUT altering my bios or hurting my machine in any way. I also want to preserve its life and not burn it, or make it die prematurely if i leave it non stop for mining, because after all im just some guy that chipped in to buy a new gpu and would be really bad for me if it failed, not a seasoned miner with a bunch of gpus and if one dies has no effect on me.

Normally theres plenty guides out there but they all alter the bios, and i want to still use this machine for my browsing, chatting and gaming, and when im sleeping or working, since i never power it down just earn a little bit of revenue maybe.

In the imgur post i attach my current results and settings, please guide me if youre in the know.

One notable detail that i want to add is, that in afterburner some settings seem to not want to go on the values i set, and most importantly, for some very weird and upsetting reason, when i increase the memory clock at anything over 1750 My screens (dual -trial setup) start to flicker. Only when i go lower than that they stop. Do i have a bad faulty card, or why is that?

Thank you for your time!

   * Who makes the proof? Is this process decentralized?
   * Is it correct that the proofs are submitted onto L1, and that based on them I could, in theory, recreate all the merkle trees to prove my claim for some amount of assets?
* For xDai...
   * It focuses around DAI, and from my understanding you bridge DAI, but otherwise you can pretty much do whatever you would do on mainnet. Why the choice of staying with DAI if it is compatible for all assets? Why not just bridge ETH, and then do L2 swaps for DAI?
   * Is it really just the mainnet with different ""decentralization parameters""? Different consesus, but way way faster?

Thoughts on Ethereum‚Äôs culture,"I was initially disappointed to find that Ethereum‚Äôs community and culture seems to be far less energetic and active than Bitcoin‚Äôs. However, I think this is actually indicative of the power of Ethereum. Bitcoin, having little-to-no utility (which is perfectly okay), has to build extremely strong narratives to keep the perceived value high. Ethereum on the other hand, doesn‚Äôt need these narratives because of the utility of the chain. Both are fine approaches, but when someone sees that there are less Ethereum memes and the price is still going up, they should see it as a positive sign of Ethereum‚Äôs utility. 

Maybe you can tell a token‚Äôs level of utility by the non-correlation between its price and the number of memes about it.

Yeah, so I'm just starting off with cryptocurrencies but it all looks so damn promising. I'm seeing new and lots of people predicting that the price of Ethereum could skyrocket to nearly $10,000 or even further, just like bitcoin.

How/where do I start?

What's the main website to buy from?

Should I be using cold storage? Like with one of the encrypted USB drives?

Could I instead just put it on a USB? I doubt even if my house gets robbed that they would find it so should that be ok? Or is there some other concerns with it? I won't be likely using it outside of my home.

1559 and the Burning Theory wedge,"Why destroy real value today, to possibly maybe perhaps have greater value at some undetermined point in the future.

The argument is that by reducing supply, that should in theory increase the value of every remaining unit. But in reality that's not exactly how it seems to happens.

I'll give you a concrete example: Stellar's XLM. In Nov 2019 they decided to burn 50% of their supply. According to the Burning Theory, this move should have double the price of every unit, right? There was a short pump, and then a few weeks later the price went back to pre-burn levels. Stellar had literally burned billions with zero lasting effects. Price stagnated until the recent bull market from the end of 2020 that saw all crypto raise.

That's my anti-burn argument. The illusion that burning will have some long lasting effects on the unit price is to me just that, an illusion, and it just needlessly removes capital from circulation.

"After the summer of DeFi and with NFT art currently in the spotlight, is gaming the next wave of Ethereum innovation?","I wanted to write a little bit about one of the lesser discussed narratives i've been tracking over at: [r/EthGamers](https://new.reddit.com/r/EthGamers/) which is the story of blockchain gaming.

During the network crippling, perfect storm that was the launch of Cryptokitties, the potential and the challenges of blockchain gaming were both abundantly on display.

On one hand, the concepts of in game item ownership, integrated economics and exciting new partnerships between player communities and developers was emerging, on the other, nobody really knew how this thing was going to work, and what was even possible. Cryptokitties was a great proof of concept, but what was next?

Over the interim years, it's a been a rollercoaster of experimentation - both on the protocol and the application layers - and to be honest, there have been as many misses as there have hits. Even early pioneers like Dapper labs have had to roll with the punches as hard lessons have been learnt.

Fundamentally, we're breaking entirely new ground. And while many traditional game studios have taken an interest, and alternatively many crypto enthusiasts have spun up game studios promising the world, the difficulty of combining interesting game mechanics, with integrated economic dynamics is fascinatingly difficult. The broad multi-disciplinary requirement inherent in blockchain gaming development isn't to be underestimated.

Words such as ""play to earn"" were intended to guide us towards an alternative model to the incumbent, broken models of digital asset ownership and gaming, and a range of early explanations of why this was game-changing (""Vitalik lost his warlock, imagine if you could just fork the game and start again"") were often found to be solutions looking for problems, and distractions from the actual work studios were doing to explore and build balanced ""player owned gaming"".

And exploring they were - from taking traditional games and adding on item and loot drops, in-game currencies that could be moved to main-chain, scarcity models, pre-sales, fully on-chain gaming, fully-off chain gaming with composability, economic gaming, item rarity, gacha rolls, item ""breeding"", land assets, wealth generating assets, vanity assets, we've got to a point where a lot of things have been attempted, and we're finally starting to see a few of them stick.

The challenge remains, how do we create a truly fair, enjoyable economic distribution, that can sustainably create an enjoyable game mechanic in the long term? That remains accessible, play-to-earn, and isn't swamped by whales, or early players using their advantage against others. Oh, and after all this, it needs to be a quality (A+) game as well.

While DeFi and MemeFi degens were rampaging over summer, almost all trading under a certain amount on OpenSea was quickly subdued by high gas prices. Unless you were moving an exclusive land parcel on Decentraland, or a world class player card on Sorare, it just wasn't worth it. The flux earning and card forging system of God's Unchained had to be put on ice, and Small Love Potions in Axie were no longer worth redeeming regularly.

And so the story shifted, the studios put their heads down and had to come up with new solutions, with Matic stepping into the void left by Loom, Axie Infinity investing in their alternative known as Ronin, and Immutable starting the market leading work with Stark labs to create their own scaling alternative: Immutable X. Release date, months not years?

While we're still not out of the woods, and it's going to take a few more months of seriously hard work to overcome these scaling challenges, there's definitely something in the air.

As DeFi and NFT Art finally get their time in the sun after years of similar experimentation, there's a lot on the horizon in terms of the Metaverse (Decentraland, Cryptovoxels, The Sandbox etc.), new innovation (Dark Forest, Immutable X), games using Matic, Enjin and other solutions to overcome scaling challenges today (Neon District, Hash Rush, Ethernal etc.) and those just pushing through with today's gas prices (F1 Delta Time, Brave Frontier Heroes etc.).

On top of all this, Axie Infinity has been posting some seriously impressive growth numbers, and has an active community of players around the world who are truly using the game to make money week on week.

It's a small, hardened community of early adopters and like most communities in this space - the longer you've been here, the more scar tissue you've picked up along the way, but i'm fascinated to see where they get to in 2021.

Recovery from Samsung Blockchain Keystore,"Thanks for your time in reading this -- I am really at wits end, getting no support from Samsung on this issue at all.

I created a wallet with MEW on my Samsung device. Inside, I hold ETH and an ERC-20 coin. MEW seems to have integrated with the Samsung Blockchain Keystore, so any transactions out of the wallet need to be verified with a PIN. I no longer have this PIN and there seems to be no way to reset it. Further, there is no way to reset/delete the Samsung Blockchain Keystore without the PIN.

I do have the 12 word mnemonic passphrase. On a different device, I see I can access an existing wallet with MEW using the mnemonic phrase, however I don't understand the implications of this. Will this move everything off my device and the wallet it holds and into the new wallet, or just allow me to look inside?

And similarly, if I bought thousands of dollars worth of ETH and sold it once the price rises shortly after I feel like I would obviously make a quick profit. 

However, I never find any guides explaining something to similar this or even suggesting to do this. 'Day trading' seems like something completely different to what I explained unless I'm just missing something (or I'm an idiot).

\- What information is available from the original signed transaction (original time of signing (not time of  presentation to the blockchain). How was the transaction signed?

First Ethereum Dapp (Contributor Credits),"Hi guys,

Two friends and I have finished our first DApp, called *Contributor Credits* ([www.contributorcredits.com](https://www.contributorcredits.com)). 

The idea is to give (hobby / side) projects a way of giving stake in their success without jumping through the legal hurdles of issuing equity (or even founding an entity). Contributor credits makes it very easy to create a new token so project owners can pay their contributors with a promise of future payment (if the venture is successful).

Optionally, these tokens can be partially funded (by a backing stable coin). Once an agreed upon trigger is reached (investment or yearly revenue for example) the issuing party is required to fully fund the Contributor credits (i.e. match the issued tokens with the backing stable coin).

The project is very much MVP stage, but if you guys want to give it a spin on Ropsten we would be very glad to get some feedback! The source code of the smart contract can be found here: [https://github.com/sunshine-labs/cc-smart-contract](https://github.com/sunshine-labs/cc-smart-contract) (any feedback here is also very welcome)

Am I a prisoner in the ETH network?,"Hello people,

Gas fees are currently quite high, which makes it almost impossible to perform transactions effectively.

Yes, even switching to alternatives (L2, Cardano, Polkadot) is associated with high gas fees.

I am a big fan of Ethereum, but these gas fees are absolute hell.

And currently there are good alternatives that are technologically more advanced than Ethereum such as Polkadot that already have their parachains now (which Ethereum doesn't want to bring until around 2023?).

I decided to take some ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum and invest in ADA/DOT. However, I will leave my ETH (just not reinvest it).

But now I feel like a prisoner in the Ethereum network. Trading for say DAI to sell it and then buying DOT/ADA has absolutely high gas costs. For the smallest amounts, you already pay over $11 in fees. Same for changing to L2 inside Ethereum (I did, paid $1 for 40 gwei but had to wait \~2 hours)

Is there no way to get out of the network cheaply? :'D

How to recover ethereum wallet?,"Hey, 

A few years ago I bought some etherum on a whim. I saved (or thought I saved) all the information for it and then pretty much forgot about it. Now I have a sheet of paper with my ethereum information and honestly I don't know what to do with it. The paper says:  


{""address"": ""40 hex chars"", ""crypto"":{""cipher"": ""aes-128-ctr"", ""ciphertext"": ""42 hex chars"", ""cipherparams"": {""iv"": ""32 hex chars""}, ""kdf"": ""scrypt"", ""kdfparams"": {""dklen"": 32, ""n"": 6\_digit\_decimal\_num, ""p"": 1, ""r"" 8, ""salt"": ""74 hex chars""}, ""magic"": 64 hex chars""}, ""id"": ""UUID"", ""version"": 3}  


(The character counts may be wrong cause I'm counting characters from a sheet of paper). 

If I had picked a password, then I know what password I would have picked. I used something called 'mist etherum wallet', but a quick google suggests that it's deprecated/no longer in dev. The etherum website lists like dozens of wallets to pick from and I have no idea what the difference is ???  


Can someone point me to a guide about what the best / safest way is now to get access to my eth again and sell it? Thanks!",ethereum,1610852766,akedbareat,22,1,True,2021-01-16

What keeps testnet coins from obtaining value?,"Hopefully, this is a good forum to ask this question  


I find that obtaining testnet coins on various network can sometimes turn into a challenge regardless of the existence of faucets.

So since they are hard enough to obtain, what mechanism ensures that they have no value?  
I would guess people that need them for development/experimentation purposes would be willing to pay a small amount for them.  
If we look at other networks like Caradano, they even rolled out incentivized testnets that give real rewards, which should also make the testnet token valueable.

Lowering the barriers of participating in PoS,"One of the initial barriers to staking is the hefty 32 ETH minimum to run a node. This is pretty easily overcome by users pooling their money together so a node can be run.

The bigger problem is trying to avoid slashing. Who will actually run and control the node(s) for the pool? Whats the incentive for the ones running the hardware? How do you guarantee the one running the PoS node doesn't lose your staked ETH?

Rocketpool lets individuals operate chunked nodes under a root PoS node for 16 ETH. Yes easier to participate than 32 ETH, but still a considerable jump compared to someone with 0.001 ETH running mining software on their gaming rig when they aren't using it.

My question is, why stop at 16 ETH chunks of a single PoS node? Why can't a user with 0.001 ETH offer some computer power in order to ensure the root PoS node stays stable?",ethereum,1610907772,cgskook,6,1,True,2021-01-17

I believe the future of gaming is in NFTs but I need help getting it started,"I think one day all video game assets will be collectable and exchangeable NFTs, so to try and start that future I created CryptoWeapons https://app.rarible.com/cryptoweapons/collectibles which is a collection of 50 3D guns and weapon NFTs that all come with their 3D file once purchased to be used for anything!

Every weapon is unique and I made all of them from scratch. The only problem is, because of high gas fees I only have enough budget to mint 5 so far.

I feel so pathetic asking, but if someone bought just one of the weapons for 1 ETH that would be almost exactly enough to fund the minting of the other 45!

I really believe in this exciting future, and thats why with the purchase of a CryptoWeapon the buyer would have access to the exact 3D file of the gun to customize, use for game dev, for animations, or even for someone to make their own NFTs with!

I need to fund around $1,100 to $1,500 in order to mint them before gas fees get any higher. I thought about making a kick starter, but not enough ppl know  about NFTs, so I figured I would ask here directly in hopes a kind redditor is able to help.

A full explanation why ether is NOTHING like oil or gas,"Let‚Äôs say I have a car with a 14-gallon fuel tank and I want to take it on a road trip. The car is not aware of the price of gasoline, and it would not travel any farther if the price of gas would double the next day. That‚Äôs because the intrinsic utility of oil has nothing to do with its monetary value. The car needs gas because of its particular physical properties and how the ICE is designed to utilize it. If I want to drive from point A to point B and it takes a full tank to get there, it will take that full tank no matter what happens to the monetary properties of gas/oil. This is fundamentally different from how Ethereum uses ether. 

Ethereum (the network) is not trying to be money, but it utilizes ether exclusively for its monetary properties and not because it can be magically burned by an imaginary engine of sorts. It costs money to participate in the network as a miner, and their engagement is financially incentivized with ether. Block space is a scarce resource, therefore participants who wish to transact use ether to bid for it. These interactions are utilizing ether as a monetary medium of exchange. When the price of ether goes up, the ether denomination of gas prices go down. That happens because no one is using ether as gas/oil, and it is actually being used as money.",ethereum,1610772808,TheWierdGuy,41,1,True,2021-01-15

How Does Uniswap Work?,[removed],ethereum,1610597544,tpmv69,16,1,True,2021-01-13
"Ethereum, The internet for Markets. (An easy guide for newbies)","What is Ethereum? Ethereum is a platform built using blockchain that allows digital assets to be traded without a middle man. It uses this by using something called smart contracts. An easy way of explaining it would be the ""Internet for Financial Markets"". 

Just how the Internet connects computers so information can be transacted freely, Ethereum connects Buyers and sellers so they can also transact easy. On Ethereum, anyone can make a token to represent anything, from a house title, a car title, a State currency, gold, stocks, commodities, ect. When a token is built on Ethereum, it can then be traded easily with out a middle man; just like information travels through the internet without a middle man. Since Ethereum is an internet of markets, not only can you trade anything on Ethereum, you can trade any asset for any other asset. 

Hypothetically lets say you have the deed to your house on the Ethereum blockchain and you want to sell that house for Tesla stock. Well with Ethereum this is possible. Even if no one wants to buy your house with Tesla stock, Ethereum can automatically sell your house for US dollars, then in the same transaction use those dollars to buy tesla stock for the price you requested. These type of transactions are possible for for any asset that is built on Ethereum. The significance of this is that it makes a liquid market for any asset. 

The purpose of Ether, the native token for the Ethereum blockchain, is that Ether is what is used as the transaction fee for the network. Any transaction that happens on the network has to pay a small fee in Ether for the transaction to go through. This is what makes Ethereum so attractive as an investment. If everyone needs to use this coin to transact on the network, then the demand for the coin will be high. 

Currently there are hundreds of applications on Ethereum that allow you to buy, sell, loan, or borrow thousands of different tokens. If you decide to loan your USDC (Ethereum's bank backed stable coin) on an Ethereum application, you could make around a 4% variable interest rate on your money (Try to get that from a savings account). Other applications allow you to participate in lotteries where losing tickets don't lose value and prediction markets to bet on real world event. With Ethereum, possibilities are endless. 

**Potential Risk:** Like any investment, there are some risk for this coin. First, Ethereum can only handle around 15 transactions per second. This means that the more people that try to use Ethereum, the less efficient it will be. Over the last few weeks, users of Ethereum saw transaction fees go up to $50+ for a single smart contract transaction. Although there are plans to make Ethereum more scalable in the future, accomplishing this goal will take a few years at best.

Smart contract hacks are another risk of Ethereum. Smart contracts are the programs on Ethereum that give instructions to what you want the transaction to do. Sometimes these contracts get hacked taking all the assets that the contracts can hold. Although that is usually the fault of the smart contract programmer, it is still something that is not uncommon on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Currently Ethereum is the most used and trusted smart contract blockchain. Although it has its flaws, developers are working around the clock to fix these issues and make the best product they can.",ethereum,1610598326,bitbuggs,50,1,True,2021-01-13

The dApp for salaries in Ethereum (Vitalik's dream),"Vitalik Buterin said somewhere that he regrets that Ethereum doesn't produce enough jobs/salaries.

Vitalik was unable to solve this problem, I did. I fully developed (except only for the audit of smart contracts) an MVP a dApp that incentivizes the market to calculate and pay salaries in Ethereum. This dApp is especially useful to pay salaries to scientists and free software developers. It is also useful for such things as carbon accounting.

The dApp principle is tricky:

* It locks money for an extended period of time (such as 100 years) and unlocks it to ""winning"" traders (by a principle very similar to prediction markets from gambling) after this time period passes. (Will many enough traders strive for 100-years long profits? We should also consider shortening the period (maybe to 50 years), but if just a small number of traders does want long time profits, it will be enough for the system to work.)
* My math calculations show that if traders a. do use very simple principles for profit maximization; b. (especially, best of them) predict future well-enough, then it is ""money transfer from the future"": the sum withdrawn in the present is equal (relative to market sizes) to the sum put in the future. So we can gather donations during 100 years in the future and transfer them to pay salaries now!
* The hardest issue to solve was that for this to work we need to create an oracle that will score the scientists' ratings to determine their salaries. It appeared to be impossible, but I realized that we can allocate a part of the prediction market rewards to search engine owners who would build oracles for us.
* Scores for scientists and software developers will be determined in the future: But we with a high confidence can assume that it highly correlates with the number of direct and indirect citations of a scientific work or software package and also with it being released under an open-source license.
* We accept not only donations but also have a clever system of bequests: If anyone doesn't want to donate, why not to bequest? So we can get much more money than other systems, I just call everyone to bequest all his or her funds to my dApp.

So, scientists get paid accordingly the real value of their work: the interest in their research after 100 years. It is the fair way to pay salaries for free software and science!! No need for universities and state funding anymore.

Now, as I said, the MVP is ready. I need exactly $3000 for contracts audit + some money for contracts deployment. Somebody, please help me to accomplish this. (I do have $3000, but I am considering tradeoffs, such as being able to pay for advertising it to kick-start the project afterwards.) Please contact me if you want to donate. (There is a grant on GitCoin, but it is now not in donations a match period; so donors please keep in contact with me.)

Links:

* [Demo app](https://vporton.github.io/future-salary/#/) (it misses donations in ETH instead of tokens and missed advanced bequests, I am working on this and have partially done it, as it can be added even after releasing an MVP on the mainnet.)
* [Temporary site](https://reward.portonvictor.org/) (significantly outdated, I added a few new ideas/changes to my dApp afterwards).
* [Source code](https://github.com/vporton/donations) (see also dependencies).

A side chain for trusted debate (Vitalik‚Äôs Mentality),"Vitalik Buterin once said that he wished that all parties of a debate should be trusted by signature and mathematical proof.

Vitalik was unable to solve this riddle. I did. From scratch, I fully developed the smart contracted needed to pull off this feat (apart from the audits as this is yet to unfold) as a beta side chain that validates trust on the parties that with to parley amongst themselves. Alongside this it is useful for things such as raw theory.

The side chain theory is tricky:

-	We need to guarantee that debate participants will live to be 200 years old as the first 100 years are required for fraud verification on scientific proof. Because we cannot probe theory to be correct we need to wait an appropriate amount of time to optimistically guarantee this (we should shorten the period if more debatists get bred.)
-	My swing o meter shows that if debates go too much away from the person who is wrong then we will a) lose the theory, and b) need recovery steps from an oracle. To achieve this we need to debate ourselves in the future to guarantee oracle participation.
-	By far the most difficult quorum is that debates need participates who are versed in scripture and in law, and without this the Ethereum oracle can not resolve
-	Without many debate participants we risk falling below the threshold. Please see my curve analysis for this as it should explain everything.
-	Right now you will find only donations through time and money will be accepted. We are grouping together to be stronger and we will it accept anything beyond your time and money as this is the fairest way to ensure finality.

So to summarise. This means that debates with many participants can happen on the blockchain, and guaranteed by the oracle. There is no lore reason for TV debate!! This is trust indivisible. No need for politicians. We can spread their salaries.

As stated. This is ready to go. I need exactly 3200 hours of human life to achieve through debate. Thanks to the self sustained ProofOfDebate engine the first 3200 hours will be enough to sustain the system for over 200 years. This is Vitaliks Mindset. (There is a go fund me also to prove how fucking trash this sub is)

Understanding Smart Contracts - For Complete Beginners?,"Hey r/ethereum, 

I'll start by saying I'm completely new to Ethereum and I've been trying to do some research on crypto and blockchains in general. I think I have a relatively decent (high level) understanding of those concepts, but I'm really trying to wrap my head around smart contracts. 

Again, keeping it high level, the way that I understand it is that smart contracts are an agreement between parties and executed when certain conditions are met (also public on the blockchain). So basically, as an example, Adam and Tim are engaged in a smart contract like ""**If Adam pays Tim 300 ether, Then Tim gives Adam his house.**"" Using this scenario, I have two questions:

1. How do these two parties actually engage in this contract? Where do they write this up and formally agree (sign) on? In theory, would a dApp need to be created to facilitate this in a more formal/user friendly manner? (I'm still new to understanding dApps as well). I'm trying to understand how this works from a user-facing perspective of engaging in this type of contract (e.g. do they go to a website, sign something on the blockchain somewhere, etc.?) 
2. Seeing as these transactions are ""trustless"" in that there is no central authority, who's to say that if Adam DOES pay Tim the 300 ether, Tim won't just say ""well... I have my money now and I'm not giving you the house."" ‚Äì Who essentially actually ENFORCES this type of contract, if not a third party? Does the law apply to these as well, in that Adam could get a legal team involved to be sure that he gets the house, as his payment is publicly available?  

Overall, I'm just trying to understand from a real-life perspective of how these smart contracts work, as the ""beginners"" references I've seen are pretty much the ""if give ether, then get house"" example with no further explanation. Any help or pointing me in the right direction is greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

i've just did alot of research about cryptocurrencies lately, out of interest and also because of a potential investment for the future. I don't like bitcoin because of its insanely big ecological footprint. So, i've read that Ethereum2.0 will use Proof of stake instead of proof of work. 

But i did not read if ETH2 will be a new currency or if ETH simply will get ""updated"" to ETH2, or if you can change your ETH into ETH2 coins. Does anyone know anything about this?

That‚Äôs a lot of new money to come into Bitcoin, just prior to the insurrection against the US Capitol.  Does that timing seem at all suspicious to you?

How does the mining payout rate tie back to ETH's current price?,"I'm sure this has been asked and answered but I couldn't find it when I searched so here goes. 

I've been mining ETH casually with my GPU (RTX 2080) for a few years now and off and on with other GPUs before that. I primarily use Nicehash BTW.

So my question is...how exactly is my payout rate per MH/s determined?

I always thought it was tied somehow to ETH's price but recently I've seen ETH stay the same and mining payouts drop...A LOT.

About a week ago I built a dual RTX 3070 dedicated miner.

The day I bought the cards Nicehash calc had me at $7.50 a day per card and for the first 2 days that's what I pulled. 

Now I'm pulling under $4 per card but my MH/s is the same and ETH's price is only down about $100.

Can someone explain this or link me to a post / video where it was answered?

"Is it safe to develop, deploy and manage DeFi apps?","The legality and regulation of crypto currencies have been in discussion for over a decade now, with some governments taking a permissive approach, and others being hostile towards it.

In recent years Ethereum-based DeFi tokens gained traction bringing forth platforms allowing people to lend or borrow funds from others, speculate on a range of assets using derivatives, trade cryptocurrencies, insure against risks, and earn interest in a savings-like account.

As someone interested in this space I wonder, to what kind of legal risks are maintainers of these platforms exposed to by developing, deploying and managing DeFi apps?

Let's change the r/Ethereum header image! Call for thoughts and submissions.,"Friends,

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a long, long LONG time since we had a bit of a makeover here on r/ethereum. Fun fact (as pointed out on twitter): [the block number featured in the current header](https://twitter.com/_czepluch/status/1346235878449029122?s=19) reflects the date of 7 Aug, 2015.  That said, this thing has probably seen enough blocks.

&amp;#x200B;

A suggestion was made after a mod discussion to call for submissions and ethereum-related art to use in the header spot! Now, rather than making a contest out of it, we'd like to just do a better job to more regularly spruce up the place using some of what comes in if that sounds alright. 

&amp;#x200B;

That said, anything that's free or open source is fair game. Whether it's a copy of an NFT that you own, the graphics from industry teams or [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org), your old posts from r/EthereumArtists or more -- feel free to throw them in below!

&amp;#x200B;

And if this sounds great to you, who0o!  But if you have input or strong feelings on process, chime in below with thoughts rather than art.",ethereum,1610475217,JBSchweitzer,48,3,True,2021-01-12

Wallet Characteristics,"Hey all, I'm still fairly new to crypto and am unsure about what to share vs. what not to share publicly.

"Got ¬£10K in ETH, do I trade it all for BTC?","Yo guys, just another noob riding this bull.

My thought process is that if I can buy and own 10is full ETHs, currently valued at around ¬£950 ($1278) a piece, would it be worth transferring it all to BTC (sitting at ¬£27k)? I'm not sure if owning a fraction of a BTC is more or less beneficial than owning 10 entire ETHs. 

Am I mistaken for thinking that owning an entire token gets you more gains than owning a fraction of another, even with the same 'monetary' value? (In my case, GoodBoyPoints.)

Ethereum still not accessible to the masses.,"So I've got a little bit of eth that I managed to dig up in an old wallet and decide I'm gonna sell it.

Do a quick search and it's hard to find something trustworthy. Someone says **geth**. Gross, it has a fucking installer. No standalone. At least it extracts with 7zip. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand nope it's garbage; just command line shit.

See **WallETH** suggested. Shit tier interface. Can't even back out of it as it just loops on itself. 

Someone says **metamask**. Hmm no proper Windows client either and I don't trust crypto management as a browser plugin. Ok fine lets try another android client. Can only access with 12 word seed. No option for private key and for whatever reason I only have a pass phrase for ETC not ETH stored in my old keepass entry for it.

**Jaxx.io**, another fucking installer. God forbid I get a standalone portable client. Can't extract this one. Cool. Pass.

Fuck it, we'll go old school, **myetherwallet**. Nope, site loads as a blank on desktop browsers.

The hardest part in finding a way to access and manage funds is finding something trustworthy. Once found, it has to actually work and be user friendly. So far ethereum is failing.

Question on POS staking pools,"So I'm obviously, no expert here. But I've recently started reading on POW and POS and I just thought of a simple question here.

With POS implemented, obviously, with the current (and growing) market cap fo Ethereum, it's probably going to be hard to buy enough eth to stake 51% (the price of Eth would probably also skyrocket at this point).

However, with the number of mining pools emerging (which because the price of Eth is likely to increase over time and you need to stake 32 entire Eth coins to validate, it's very likely that most people will have to use mining pools to stake), wouldn't it become an issue?

Even right now, isn't most of the mining power controlled by mining pools?

Like in theory, if let's say some hackers or some powerful people (let's just assume there is a way) gets their hands on just a few of the largest staking pools and just happens to obtain more than 51% of the Eth staked, or maybe just control of the validator of these mining pools, wouldn't they be able to make an attack?

Or perhaps I'm just missing something here? Probably more likely to be that but I'm just trying to understand.",ethereum,1610255232,wenxuan27,10,1,True,2021-01-09

Bitcoin has found its niche as a store of value but is rather useless as digital money because of poor transaction rates. It seems Bitcoin hasnt made much progress regarding transaction rate at all and the community is extremely conservative with experimenting. Is this statement also true? Or am I biased.

It seems to me that if cryptocurrencies are really going to take off some time then transaction rates have to come up by orders of magnitude. Or we are forever stuck as a store of value.

Inability for long-term planning when using ETH as a business owner,"I am slowly digging into ETH and ETH2.0. My question is as follows: 

1. Alice owns an online gallery of images. Other users can pay $0.001ETH (currently $1.2) and obtain the use rights to the images. 
2. The network fees are $0 and we use ETH2.0 (this is an asumption to simplify the calcs).
3. Alice accumuluates the proceeds at her ETH wallet. 
4. Bob is a contractor who creates images for Alice. The pay is 50% of the selling price, i.e. $0.5.
5. Alice pays Bob on the first day of the month following the month during which his photos were bought. 
6. Now, let's imagine the following scenario: 

a. that Alice sold 100 images (100 images \* 0.001ETH \* $1.2 = $120). 

b. Then, ETH nosedives 30% which results in Alice having only $80. 

c. She pays $60 to Bob, while she retains only $20 in profits, as opposed to the expected profit of   
$60.

My Loss,"Posting with an alt account. 

I've been heavily involved in cryptocurrency since I discovered Bitcoin in 2013. 
I did a college presentation on it and my whole class were astounded by the idea. 
I invested all of my 8,000 savings into a Scrypt ASIC miner from KNCMiner. They take deposits, in full, pending shipping at a later date. They take 12 months before they finally ship. When they eventually do, they shipped a weaker chip, multiple users having high failure rates, no possibility of turning a profit with it.
I joined a class action to help get a refund for it, hoping that European consumer laws would apply, unfortunately they didn't, and my hands were tied. I had no choice to sell it - I made back 15% of the price paid by selling it in ebay. 

I go back to my studies in Computer Science, graduate, have two beautiful kids and settle down with a job for a bit. 
Fast forward to late 2016. I get back into the crypto world. Start reading here and there, putting in small amounts. Discovered Ethereum and put in whatever I had spare at the time (about 4k).
I set a personal goal of 60k - enough to pay a mortgage down payment and pay off my loans. 
I take a little but of time off from work to trade more. 
After many many sleepless nights of trading, arbing, ICOs, I am nearly at the cashout goal that I initially set. I wake up one morning, I am literally on doing my business checking my phone for the latest prices - to my surprise Ethereum spiked during the night, I quickly go to check my address on Etherscan(just a thing I liked to do), to my absolute shock I see a transaction go through at 4am, I've never ran to the computer faster in my life. 
I checked over my address, checked token transactions, everything gone(about 50 Eth with tokens). My address was wiped clean - apart from one token(which was thankfully locked due to an ICO(REQ)), and a little bit of dust in alts. So, I try transferring in some eth to get the alt tokens out, the eth is immediately transfered out of my account(whoever compromised my address put a sweeper bot on it, making it nearly impossible to beat).
 - I never did find out exactly how I got hacked at the time. Obviously (And stupidly) not having a HW wallet was the main part of it( I got a one immediately after, obviously too late). I had received some calls from a Google Voice number a couple of days prior, didn't think much of it at the time. I also stupidly had remote desktop enabled on my computer for accessing the miners I had running in my house. 
 
This loss was a big hit to my mental health. I struggled for a good while after that. 

I was desperate to recover the losses (I put back in the last 2k of my savings). Trading as much as I could, arbing whatever/wherever I could. I was happy, I was gaining back and confident I could recoup the loses from the hack - then WEX.nz happened. This one but hard, as the previous hack was still an open wound. 
Wex.nz(formerly BTCe) had some nice arbitrage opportunities that I wanted( naively) to take advantage of. Suddenly withdrawals were disabled. The exchange still functioned for some time, allowing me to trade within that, I continued to trade, hoping that if crypto rises the exchange may enable withdrawals. Some months passed, the admins go quiet. There's chatter on Telegram channels that the exchange was sold to Dmitry Havchenko, a former Ukrainian entrepreneur turned separatist fighter.. ok, doesn't sound that bad... Fast forward another couple of months, WEX goes offline(domain shutdown because of the scan complaints). Now I realize there's no hope.. I go back to my career as a Software Developer for a short time. Fast forward to early 2019. I invest small bit of money that I saved up while working. I start reading on the side. Checking arbitrage opportunities here and there. Getting caught back into crypto, feeling sorry for myself again and trying to recoup past losses(fool me once right...), I see an arbitrage opportunity on BiteBTC (the name rang a bell, I remembered trading on it a small bit prior and not having any issues.). I try to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity and deposit whatever I had(5 Eth). Sure enough, withdrawals aren't processing - withdrawal gets cancelled. I wait for support... Fast forward a month or two, BiteBTC goes offline. I've lost hope for that one now. There's chatter on Telegram that BiteBTC is coming back as Fedlio.com(who claimed to be owned by Seychelles Commercial Bank - of course this turned out to be false claim). Fedlio comes online(and still is to this day- stay away!!!) and I am able to login with my old account. My account is ""pending verification"" - the only way to verify is to fill out the physical form with a copy of my ID and post to them in the Seychelles (not happening...). So I give up on that one. 


I've been scammed more times than I would like to admit at this stage. 

Here I am now watching Bitcoin breaking new highs, Ethereum thriving and very close to it's ATH and really itching to get back into cryptocurrency and still have 10k in debt. 


Thanks if you've gotten this far. I've held off posting this for quite some time.

Tracing Ethereum transactions,"It's not a secret that Ethereum blockchain is consistent and transparent for observation. From a side of trust this is wonderful, but what if you don't want to be identified while enjoy Ethereum opportunities? 

Bitcoin blockchain is already became almost not anonymous due to such organizations as [AMLBot](https://t.me/cryptoaml_bot) and [Crystal](https://crystalblockchain.com). The approach to identify abstract user is simple:

1. Find interested wallet
2. Trace it till known exchange
3. Request owner's personal data 

I have to say, that this is not such hard: known Blockchain tracers provide automated solutions to find the whole way of cryptocurrency from anonyms wallets to known entities (exchanges, custodial wallets etc.) and having some juridical power (e.g. intelligence services have) allow to request owner's personal data in just a week, whoop.. abstract wallet had became a concrete person.

Crystal is already implementing tracing for Litecoin and Ethereum blockchains. Also, I want to admit [WhaleTrace](https://whaletrace.com) which is tracing and sending notifications about transactions in hundreds of blockchains following user determined parameters.

**Don't you dare to think that Ethereum will become an open-book with actually no anonymity guarantees?**

Even cross-blockchain swaps through [REN Protocol](https://renproject.io) won't drop tails if wrap, say, Bitcoin into Ethereum (wBTC) and reverse: do comply time and value between incoming transaction in blockchain A and outcoming transacation in blockchain B to continue tracing in another blockchain.

**The solution:** r/BuccaneerV2 smart-contract on Ethereum. It have been developed in the middle 2020 and the core feature is that all transactions within the application goes hidden from Etherscan, while they actually written in Ethereum blockchain and share all its benefits such as decentralization and trustless. Every new transaction delete information about previous ones and constantly increase difficulty of identification.

Literally, no information about transactions, check it [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd5a7d515fb8b3337acb9b053743e0bc18f50c855) *all the transactions are interactions with transparent [Uniswap: BUCC Liquidity Pool](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x7772612549F27Aa49c83Fa59ab726f4799E4ecDc), but no BUCC transfers itself, no holders, no value... but they exist.

I read a lot about crypto, even more lately than usual, and of course I'm as excited about the run-ups lately as anyone else; however, I'm also seeing and hearing a lot of old-money people jumping into the space who seem to think that Bitcoin is ""very early technology"".  I just don't see it that way at all.  I'm not even going to look for the exact dates and times right now, but Bitcoin has been around a long, long time.  Ages in internet/tech years. I know it has some advances happening, but it looks nothing like the innovation happening around ethereum.

It's amusing, interesting, funny to a degree that old-money pouring into Bitcoin thinks it's in it's early stages of development.  Are they confusing Bitcoin with Ethereum?  I dunno.  Maybe.  I'm sure it's all good, but at the same time that I'm slightly amused about it, I'm a bit concerned.  While bitcoin has a massive presence and well-known descriptor, it just looks very stale and aged compared to what is happening in the Ethereum ecosystem and what we know is about to happen in coming years with Eth2.

EIP-1559 &amp; Gas Fees (Question),"Hello everyone, I am relatively new to the space of crypto and trying to learn as much as possible about ethereum.

I have heard that gas fees are very high right now because of the congestion of the network. I know that ETH 2.0 fixes this but it‚Äôs still a long way from actually lowering the gas fees, which could be detrimental as users could choose to move to low fee platforms such as Cardano or Tezos.

Now I have read about EIP-1559 and I think I get the general idea of how it can fix gas fees. What I don‚Äôt seem to understand is the following : 

Is EIP-1559 meant to be only a sort of transition solution to lower the gas fees while we wait for ETH 2.0, or is it still gonna be there when it‚Äôs fully implemented?

With Ethereum, there's so many different wallets, and a bunch of them seem to be tied to a particular website/centralized point of failure.

Question about trustless smart contracts,"I've been thinking a lot about trustless business transactions using Ethereum.

Let's say I am a manufacturer selling smart phones to a large retailer. I have a good reputation doing business with a retailer. In the past, I have always delivered what the retailer has asked for. Let's say I have many times manufactured smart phones that cost my company $4,800,000 to produce, and I have always sold these orders for $5,000,000 to large retailers, with a profit of $200,000 per order.

After years of doing business, I am ready to retire. I send a box full of paperweights that weigh and look the same as the smart phones I have delivered to the retailer over the years. The currier confirms that the retailer received the goods. My money goes to the retailer via the smart contract.

If I receive fake goods, what is my recourse as a retailer? The contract has already paid the manufacturer. The currier says the order was received by me, you can't expect a currier the inspect every sealed box and know what they're looking for.

In this case, wouldn't I, as the retailer, need a legal entity to sue the manufacturer? Doesn't this defeat the purpose of a trustless system?

Please explain that I'm wrong. I want to invest in ethereum but I wonder whether this has all been and accounted for somehow. What am I missing here?",ethereum,1610223357,BurningPoopBag,0,1,True,2021-01-09

A mechanism like this would also help to restraint the risks involved with staking pools becoming too powerful.

Gas. I know gas it's used to process transactions, such as for example doing something in a crypto based game (CryptoKitties etc). I bought a lot of tokens back then, hoping they would increase in value (which I believe they did), BUT.... Gas price made everything worse. It literally is impossible to do anything since gas is so high that it's not worth doing anything with those tokens.....

Why would **big finance players** want services decentralized? What benefits would why have?

Layer 2 and scattering of Ethereum,"This year we will start seeing projects migrating to the so called layer 2, but I have one concerned I would like to share with you.

One of the coolest things that I like of Ethereum, is that I can just go to etherscan and see whats happening in the network. Everything is recorded there.

But what would happen once projects start moving to layer 2? Don't you think this will scatter the network? We will have tons of transactions across different sidechains, zk rollups, optimistic rollups. Perhaps it is not a problem per se, but it worries me.

Some random ideas:

* Lets say we have an ERC20 token X. This token will be swapped in the already existing layer 1 + on multiple rollups and sidechains. The same token will be scattered across many different ""worlds"". Have you heard about any project that aims to keep track of this?
* Most of the sidechains or rollups have a block explorer, but all of them are different. Do you think we will have some kind of next gen etherscan that will be able to browse through the whole Ethereum network, including l2?",ethereum,1609887957,jbj-fourier,2,1,True,2021-01-05

Criticism of proof-of-stake,"**Hey, mods!** My previous post was removed without providing a reason, so just to let you know: This isn't my personal criticism of proof-of-stake, this is just a summary of the most popular criticism that has been acknowledged by Vitalik himself.

If you still think this post is not appropriate for this sub, please let me know how I can improve it.

\-------

Check out my previous post: [What is proof-of-stake?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kr6zd7/what_is_proofofstake/)

Even though proof-of-stake gathers a lot of enthusiasts because of its significantly lower operation costs and decreased risk of centralization compared with proof-of-work, it‚Äôs not completely without criticism.

***Nothing At Stake***: problem -&gt; solution -&gt; bigger problem?

Consensus is the defense mechanism of a blockchain. Every created block has to be approved by the majority of the network, otherwise it‚Äôs rejected. The next question that arises is: **how can we make sure that the majority won‚Äôt approve fraudulent blocks?**

Imagine you have two drivers and two identical cars that have no gas in them. Your task is to get one of those cars to a certain far distance as quickly as possible. The catch - you can only spend $20 on gas.

Your best bet is to choose one car and spend all $20 to fuel it up. Splitting the money between them will make sure none reach the finish line.

**Proof-of-work** requires a miner to use external resources (dedicated hardware and electricity) to participate, because of that they have to decide which of all possible forks to contribute to. They could in theory approve both fraudulent and correct blocks, but that *significantly* lowers their chance to be rewarded, making the effort non-profitable - just like splitting 20 bucks for gas for two cars.

If a blockchain were to use another consensus algorithm, it cannot simply allow participants cost free. Otherwise they‚Äôd approve any block they like while having nothing to lose.

*Solution*: validators have to deposit their coins in order to participate in the network. If they double-vote, they lose their money.

Problem solved, right? Well...

**Will the rich get richer?**

A valid concern is that since proof-of-stake favors those validators who have contributed the most, only the richest participants will be chosen and paid by the algorithm, making them even richer and more likely to be chosen again.

The man himself seems to dismiss this problem altogether:

&gt;the rewards in general \[...\] will be quite low; in eth2, we are expecting annual validator rewards to equal \~0.5-2% of the total ETH supply. And the more validators are staking, the lower interest rates get. ([source](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/06/pos2020.html))

One solution is coin age-based selection implemented by Peercoin: once a stake of coins has been used to validate a block, it must wait for a certain period of time before validating another block.",ethereum,1609906962,BlueEstee,19,1,True,2021-01-05

"EIP1559, ETH 1.5 Sharding &amp; Berlin Hard Fork","Hey guys,

Recently, since the release of the Beacon Chain I recall a post from Vitalik on twitter regarding the progress of the Ethereum network and the ongoing developments. With the successful release of the Beacon Chain coming on at the expected date where do we stand with the other following updates?

I recall some articles stating the Berlin hard fork was pencilled in for January but I haven't seen anything as of yet or any updates since October 2020. Does anyone have any news on the network update?

EIP1559 I know is still not ready and I am releastically expecting it's change roughly 2021 Q3 unless anyone has anything more specific?

Finally with both Berlin and EIP1559 currently progressing does everything think that this year will Ethereum also go through the 1.5 Sharding changes? I just feel that while the team has done an amazing job with the Beacon Chain they aren't always the most reliable when it comes to how long things are taking/progressing (""soon"").

I am a digital artist about to start selling my work as NFTs on Rarible. Could someone with experience on the platform help advise me with what art to use/general advice?,"Hi all,

I am a digital artist that actually used to be a part of a big digital art scene back in 2008-2012 where I was a member of two art collectives - [Evokeone](http://www.evokeone.com/) &amp; [Slashthree](http://www.slashthree.com/). With the growing of social media, these online art collectives became a thing of the past. Which is really sad, because I met some amazing artists who I still talk to today. However, seeing websites such as Rarible, SuperRare, Nifty Gateway, Makers Place, etc pop up I think this is a really cool resurgence of digital art in a new way that wasn't possible ten years ago, and I want to be a part of it again. 

I never really stopped making digital art in my spare time off of work, so this is where I was hoping I could use your expertise. I applied to SuperRare and Nifty Gateway, but I haven't heard back yet so I decided that I am going to upload a few pieces to Rarible. I have a few different styles where I work in -

Here is a link to my matte paintings [Matte Paintings](https://www.behance.net/gallery/73911401/Photomanipulations-Matte-Paintings-2016-2018), would these sell on this platform? I have a small following on social media, so I would obviously push them out there too (not sure how much my followers are into crypto though). Or would I be better off selling these hip hop portraits that I do on my Instagram - [@brandonspahnart](https://www.instagram.com/brandonspahnart/). These are my original digital paintings, but am I even allowed to sell them due to using pop culture? Or does that even matter? Final question about selling - if I was to animate my matte paintings, would that have a higher chance? Does animation do better than static images?

I am currently waiting on one more day for my $100 transfer from my bank account to Coinbase to go through. I set up a wallet through Fortmatic. How much do gas runs usually cost to upload to Rarible? Like 15-20 a piece? I kind of want to do this just for the fun and excitement of it. I also don't want to do this only for the money - I think this is a cool opportunity for people to see my digital art and to have a resurgence of it. But I don't want to rip through a couple hundred dollars really quick without planning ahead of time.

Tether Price Manipulation,"Hello everyone,

before you go ahead and read this, I need to mention that I'm a long term Ethereum HODLer and that I strongly believe in the notion of cryptocurrency. The intention of this post is not to spread conspiracy theories, rather, its purpose is to encourage a legitimate discussion on the topic.

Tether has been manipulating Bitcoin's price upwards for years now by printing unlimited, and unbacked USDT. This thread will cover the controversial aspects surrounding Tether, and how it will eventually meet its demise.

**A bit of a back story:**  
Tether is a stable coin that was first launched in 2012. According to the company, Tether is backed 1:1 with the U.S dollar, although this isn't actually the case. Bitfinex, and Tether have refused to show audits of their reserves, which is held in offshore bank accounts.

In 2019, The United States District Court sued Bitfinex, Tether, and Poloniex for being involved in a massive price manipulation, and fraud scheme in the crypto markets.  In a court hearing, Tether's lawyer admitted the stable coin was only backed by 74% cash, and securities.

**How the scam works:**  
Tether can print infinite amounts of (worthless) USDT.  They then inject this into BTC, ETH, LTC, (and others) to cause prices to pump. Notice how during the months they stopped printing Tether, the market moves sideways or drops significantly. Without USDT, Bitcoin wouldn't have reached 35K+

The majority of funds flowing into Bitcoin is from Tether.  When Tether ultimately meets its fate, the market will see a major correction as the lawsuit highlights how BTC isn't actually worth the insanely high prices you're seeing now.

Considering these bull runs are mostly caused by price manipulation, FOMO, and hype. The Bitcoin bubble could pop, and see large amounts of its market cap disappear in the months following Tether's demise.

As the lawsuit comes closer, Tether is printing more and more money. My guess is they know they will be found guilty, and are trying to get as much money as possible. Once this scheme is made aware to the general public, I believe it will be one of the largest scams ever.

Tether currently has the highest volume out of every cryptocurrency on the market. Many assume that when they collapse, it will not affect BTC at all.  Don't underestimate how much influence Tether has in the crypto markets right now. Without them, everything would drop.

Once Tether is gone, it will create a liquidity crisis. The money won't just flow to other stable coins, but rather destabilize the entire market:  
\- Exchanges will stop withdrawals  
\- Trading will be paused  
\- Investors will panic  
\- Prices will crash as people try to sell.

At the end of the day, nobody knows how long this scam will go on. It could be days, weeks, months, or even years before they are shut down. But educating yourself on what's happening is vital. I'm a huge proponent of Bitcoin, but this isn't sustainable.

Tether and Bitfinex are ticking time bombs. You don't want to be around them when they go bust.   Does this sound legal?  
\- Never had any audits  
\- Proxy for US Dollar  
\- Evading AML/KYC regulations  
\- Violate US Securities Law  
\- Money laundering  
\- Caught lying about Reserves

[The original Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/JacobOracle/status/1346133062204198917) was written by Jacob Oracle. I wanted to share this to open up a discussion. I think that every single crypto holder would want to know about this.

ETH Scaling Solution Optimism Set To Launch Its Preliminary Mainnet By Jan 15," 

The preliminary mainnet of Optimism, an Ethereum (ETH) scaling solution providing firm, is now ready for launch. Optimism is a layer two scaling solutions developer and is developing a layer-2 scaling solution for the world‚Äôs second-largest blockchain network Ethereum. The firm has revealed its plans recently that it is all set to roll out the preliminary mainnet.

As reported by The Block, the company is likely to launch the preliminary mainnet on the 15th of January. Reportedly, it will be the first trial run of the mainnet of the Ethereum Optimism. The first trial run of the preliminary mainnet will be rolled out together by Optimism and Synthetix, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol.

The main aim of this scaling solution will be to resolve the scaling problem of the Ethereum network. It will create a channel in order to make it possible that all of the transactions on the Ethereum network are conducted in a quick manner. This channel will also help in reducing transaction costs on the network. A total of 1.2 million transactions are currently run on the network. And the cost of a single transaction is extremely high as users are charged with a massive fee of $15 per transaction.",ethereum,1609826750,thuonghaixala,4,1,True,2021-01-04

"Thoughts on hard supply cap, inflation, deflation and ETH vs BTC","Disclaimer: I own both ETH and BTC and I think both have their place in the crytofinancial system.

Whenever I see a discussion about the merits of ETH vs BTC, it often falls back on a discussion about the benefits of a hard supply cap and the ""correct"" inflation policy for a cryptocurrency. I'd like to share an opinion I rarely see, which is that ETH not having a fixed supply cap and being (moderately) inflationary is not necessarily a bad thing, although it does mean that it will never have the same place as BTC in the cryptofinancial system.

First, let's look at BTC. BTC has a hard supply cap of 21 million BTC, which means that there will come a time where the last BTC has been mined. Obviously, this makes BTC a strong contender for the reserve asset of the future, since its limited supply means that it is shielded from the effects of runaway inflation (or any inflation for that matter). However, this fixed supply has a downside: it makes BTC a deflationary asset. Put simply, deflation is a phenomenon where the value of a currency is worth more tomorrow than it is today. If you consider the increasing demand for BTC and the fact that some BTC is constantly lost (e.g.: people losing their keys), then it is clear why BTC is a deflationary asset. This is great for hodlers, and I expect BTC to remain king in terms of value growth. However, it makes BTC unusable as the native currency of a the cryptofinancial system since spending BTC incurs an opportunity cost: since BTC is deflationary, it will be worth more in the future and therefore, over the long term, holding BTC remains the strategy that maximizes returns.

Unlike BTC, ETH does not have a fixed supply, which means that it is subject to inflation over the long term. Note that this does not mean that ETH will end up like the Venezuelan bolivar; its inflation policy is bounded and determined by the protocol itself, not by the whims and wishes of any individual. This constant (but manageable) inflation makes ETH easier to spend as ETH is unlikely to ""go up forever"". Once ETH settles at a market cap reflective of the value of the network (whatever that value may be), the constant inflation will prevent ETH from being deflationary. This will mean that spending ETH will not incur as much of an opportunity cost as spending BTC does. This obviously makes ETH less viable as a reserve asset, but it does make ETH a strong contender for the currency of the future, since an economy cannot run if no one is spending (as would be the case with BTC). I therefore expect ETH to become the more useful cryptocurrency out of the two, which we are already somewhat seeing with the rise of DeFi.

The facts described above have some interesting consequences. For starters, I do not think we will ever see DeFi/smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain, nor would it be a good thing. DeFi with BTC only would suffer from the deflationary effects of BTC (no one would engage in it as the long term opportunity cost of selling BTC for any DeFi asset would outweigh the benefits). On the other hand, this deflation makes BTC the perfect DeFi collateral (we are seeing this already in lending protocols with the amount of BTC locked in smart contracts). This also mean that I think ETH becoming deflationary (because EIP 1559 or something else) might actually harm the Ethereum platform, since if ETH joins BTC as a deflationary reserve asset, the opportunity cost of spending ETH for transaction fees might reduce the viability of dApps. 

TL;DR: BTC's fixed supply =&gt; better reserve asset, better collateral, higher opportunity cost when spending, bad currency. ETH's unlimited supply =&gt; less good reserve asset, lower opportunity cost when spending, better currency, more useful. Both compliment each other in the cryptofinancial system and DeFi is only possible with both.",ethereum,1609857545,Sh0tgunSh0gun,43,1,True,2021-01-05

Offline MEW wallet vs. hardware wallet,"This is really two questions:

1) I've made an offline MEW wallet with an airgapped Tails environment and generated my private key. I then successfully sent Eth to and from that address using offline json transfer etc. to confirm that I can control the wallet. Now my question is: in the event of catastrophe do I need to know my public address too or just the private key? I've always thought just the private key, but if a private key can generate countless public addresses then how would you know which public address to look at when recovering from your seed words? **If I look up any other public addresses related to my wallet, they show balances of 0**. Only one public address shows a balance - the one I sent my funds to. What am I missing here? I am under the impression that only private keys are necessary for recovery but failing to see how that would work.

2) With all of this in mind, my motivation for an offline MEW wallet was to avoid closed-source devices like Ledger.

Sales taxes are a burden for business - A thought experiment with ethereum.,"**Intro**

I've been an e-commerce dev for a bunch of years, and as a result I have become exposed to the nitty gritty of how businesses collect and remit sales taxes. Over the last handful of years or so, it's _mostly_ become a solved problem ... kind of. I can't speak for anyone outside the US, but I know that it's a lot easier for non-US businesses when it comes to certain aspects (I may be wrong, I know VAT in Europe can be troublesome). I also can't really speak for many US states where sales taxes are fairly simple (or non-existent). I'm going to keep referring to sales taxes in this post, but I want you to keep in mind that they could also be an analog for some other aspect of business finance that I am not thinking about - ie any time there is a ""fee"" which can't be figured out until you know who your customer is.

**Sales tax basics**

So here in my state, the way sales tax works is that as a business when a customer comes into your brick and mortar store and buys something, they pay the tax based on which jurisdictions your business exists in. This is true anywhere. You'll often have a few different taxes that add up to the total tax which may include state tax, county tax, city tax, and other special districts which can be a million different things like a region that all pays for public transit with sales taxes. This is pretty simple, relatively, and it's easy to know what to charge your customer _before_ they walk in the door.

**Sales tax not-so-basics**

But it isn't always so simple. The product you sell might have options for delivery. In which case (and depending on what state you're in), the customer comes in the store, brings something to the register to pay, and then they say ""I want this thing delivered to my house which is in another city."" The Point of Sale software (POS) will then need a different way to handle how to figure the tax. In some places, this might just be a basic two-dimensional table with a ZIP code that maps to a set of taxes to charge. That's not the case here. You basically cannot accurately determine sales tax unless you enter a specific address and some other computer system takes that address and converts it into a point on a map and then it will look at any other geographic shapes that overlap the point. If the point is inside the shape (which might be a county, a city, a state, etc) then it says ""okay charge this tax"" and if it is inside multiple shapes it says ""here's the few different taxes broken down by type - city/state/etc.

I recall some US federal act from I think the 80s that is kind of related here (I don't remember the name of the act). But this act has to do with cell phones and sales taxes and was done so that your cell provider could determine where to charge you sales tax based on where you used the phone most often and _not_ where you had the bill sent. It determines this through tower triangulation. Again, I don't recall the name of this or know if it's still used, but it's an interesting comparison.

**Third-party services**

Until recently, there's been basically two ways to figure out the sales tax you needed to charge a customer. First, you looked it up manually. You use some system which might be provided by your state or some third-party and you entered those values in an order for tax. This is a bad way to do it because there could be human error during input, the database you're looking up might be out of date, etc. The other way to do it is to subscribe to a service which helps automate this. There's a few companies out there that specialize in this. You pay them a monthly fee and/or a transaction fee each time you look up. For example, our business has used a service which is like $80/mo for 1000 lookups and each additional lookup is $0.08 each. Keep in mind, this doesn't mean an actual _sale_ is happening, you're simply inputting an address and it gives you a table of which taxes apply. You might just be giving a customer a quote which they don't purchase for a few weeks. So each individual sale will have on average more than one lookup. The service we use is very basic, but there are others that are more complex and end up being a regular monthly fee. I have done estimates for our business and it would cost us multiple thousands of dollars a month for a service that exists only to tell us how much to charge customers.

**Misc scenarios**

There are also a million other situations where things change. Maybe your city charges a sugar tax. Maybe the product is not taxable because it's a basic need. Maybe there is an exemption for a charity. The possibilities are limited only by the imagination of various political jurisdictions. 

**Why am I posting this on r/ethereum?**

So this brings me to the main point and where I see smart contracts coming into play and being useful. Doing all this work to manage sales taxes is burdensome for businesses and without experience or a CPA or other resources, it becomes a drain. The main reason for this drain is that you need to have a system built to handle every possible situation for every customer and product. For some businesses, they might not even bother to do it correctly, leading to customers being over or undercharged.

I have seen this personally when I have bought a drink that was charged a sugar tax despite it being exempt from the tax. The law is so complex that the business owner probably just charges it on everything rather than trying to figure out each individual drink's status. Or there might be a situation where the business is using a software system they have paid for, but the software is inaccurate. I recently discovered the giant gaping hole in how Shopify handles sales taxes despite their claims otherwise. Any business in our state using their service for a website or POS will either be doing it incorrectly or paying thousands of dollars a month to do it sort of correctly. 

**So how can ETH help?**

I was thinking about this last night and a very simple thought came into my head that is kind of a big paradigm shift in the assumption of what a business does when it makes a sale (or invoices a B2B client, or anything transactional in nature that is conditional based on the status of the other party). What if instead of a business needing to figure out all these millions of different things themselves and reinvent a wheel that's been invented before, that information was instead stored as part of the customer? This would take the burden off the business and allow them to remain in compliance and provide better service, more accurate pricing, and not be at a competitive disadvantage. 

**How would that work?**

Recall the situation at the beginning of this giant wall of text: Customer comes into store, picks out an item, brings it to the register, and says ""I want this delivered to my house in the next city."" This is the tricky part I have been thinking about - how can the customer's information (their address, taxable status ie wholesale/charity/tax exempt/etc) be used by a POS system to determine all of this stuff automatically so that the business doesn't have to bother with knowing anything beforehand? Existing in a smart contract that the POS would tap into, the customer's checkout is simple and quick and the business benefits because some system just managed to determine the customer's sales tax jurisdictions and add those charges to the order, then the system sets aside those funds for remittance at the end of the day (or month or quarter or whatever). This opens up new opportunities for business to improve and innovate - without these burdens they can quickly build new models that don't need six months of legwork just to handle something stupid like sales taxes.

For reference, I think our business currently has several dozen different sales tax licenses for all the cities near us. An accountant goes to each city's website and downloads their form to apply and then remits the taxes. Some cities have taxes remitted monthly. Some quarterly. Some use a PDF form. Some use a Word Doc. Some use Excel. Some accept online payments. Some require checks to be mailed. I think our state in total has 700 different sales tax jurisdictions.

**Where now?**

I don't really have much of anything to offer anyone. I am hoping that this post simply serves as a reminder that smart contracts can revolutionize business in ways that make the world a better place. I think that these thoughts, while focused on sales taxes, could be adapted for other situations where two parties need to make complicated agreements with each other based on the status of each.

"Ever wondered why Geth nodes take so long to sync on an SSD, and why SATA vs NVMe doesn't seem to matter?","https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/18204 There's your answer. Let me break it down for you:

1. User (in 2017) hates Geth sync performance and starts hacking on the code. Finds that disabling fsync makes the node sync so fast that a normal HDD can be used for syncing. (See Fsync section of this post)
2. User creates patch.
3. Many discussions take place about whether this is a good idea or not.
4. One of the discussion threads is 'isn't fsync off by default?' 'yes it is' 'but when I explicitly turn it off, things go faster.' 'yea, I see that behavior too!'
4. Charts and tests are performed to validate that explicitly disabling fsync indeed does speed up syncing.
5. Change is ultimately rejected as (paraphrasing) 'if this should be changed, Google's leveldb team should be the one to change it'.

##What the heck is Fsync?

You need to put 10 pieces of elbow macaroni into a bowl. The 10 noodles you need are already pulled out and laid on the table. There are a few ways to move them into the bowl:

1. Pick each one up, one at a time, and move it to the bowl.
2. Pick up as many as you can in small batches and drop them into the bowl in batches.
3. Sweep your hand across the table surface and move them all into your other hand, then drop all 10 into the bowl at once.

Almost everyone will be able to do #3 faster than #1 or #2. Everyone understands that #1 is the slowest. Modern computers, by default, try to do #3 when you write anything to any form of permanent storage. They try to *buffer* the data (macaroni) into a big batch, and then flush all that data to physical media at once for efficiency reasons.

Fsync is a way to force the computer to take whatever data is currently in the buffer and write it physical storage **RIGHT NOW!** It would be like if you started to sweep the macaroni into your hand, but then you saw your baby was about to fall and you only had 3 noodles in your hand; you'd (in reality drop the noodles, but meh) immediately stop trying to get more noodles, and drop them into the bowl so you could go save your baby. Fsync is that request to 'stop and flush'.

## Why does this matter?
The reason that SATA and NVMe both offer the same syncing performance (or darn near it) is because what Geth's storage backend is doing is calling fsync every single time you write to the database. They are writing to the database anywhere from 5,000 - 20,000 times per second. And that's just what they can do **with** fsync; they'd actually try to write even more often without fsync.

'But my SSD can handle 50,000 IOPS!' It can, but this is different. When you call fsync(), the function doesn't return until **after** the data is 'confirmed' as flushed to storage. That confirmation takes time, on the order of milliseconds for slow SSDs, and microseconds for fast ones. If you have to wait 100 microseconds per IO to disk, then you can only write 10,000 things to disk per second if you call fsync after each write. This also explains why some people see a huge performance difference going from SATA to NVMe and others don't. If you are going from QLC NAND in a SATA drive to 2-bit NAND in a NVMe drive, then you'll see a HUGE write speed increase (from ~1ms per write to ~50 microseconds per write). You'll be able to write data a LOT faster.

But if you have two 3-bit SSDs, one SATA, one NVMe, you'll see that they both write at basically the same speed. Or if you have one SSD with 4 memory chips and another with 2, you might see the 4-chip SSD perform better than the 2 chip, because the controller (if its smart enough) can do 4 writes at once instead of 2 {2 vs 4 * however many writes the actual memory chip can handle internally}. 

Fsync is not a bad thing, especially for a database. In fact, it's absolutely critical to good database health and performance! What is bad is that, in Geth, right now, it's being called too much.

##What needs to change?

The devs need to rethink how they interact with the storage layer. Right now, today, they simply get each transaction and write it directly to DB. Which, in turn, means fsync() is called after each and every transaction written by the internal leveldb code from Google.

What needs to happen instead is:

1. They need to define and keep record of a 'checkpoint' of what data in the DB is known-good,
2. Issue writes to the DB as they do now with fsync explicitly disabled
3. Once an interval has passed (100tx? 10 blocks? 1 second? 10 seconds? etc; some combination of criteria) they need to call fsync() once to flush the data to the DB and ensure the data is in the DB consistently, and then a second time to update the DB with the most recently written data as the current checkpoint for 'known-good' DB content.
4. Change the node boot code to look for this checkpoint, and roll back any DB commits that occurred after the checkpoint.

What I am describing is exactly how transactional databases are supposed to work. I am literally describing a traditional MySQL/Oracle DB transaction. 'Start up, do some work, commit changes as a batch; roll back everything if something goes wrong'. This is a significant change for the backend because what they have right now assumes that every single write to the DB is its own transcation, and that simply doesn't scale. It didn't work in 2017, it doesn't work in 2020.

[The last time](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/cwglyq/geth_performance_insights/) I wrote about Geth IO performance I was really mean, hostile, and toxic. I was so angry because I was convinced that the devs simply didn't care at worst, or were utterly incompetent at best. Neither were the case. They are totally willing to fix problems if someone is able to explain what is wrong and why. [The next release](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases?after=v1.9.6) after that post (1.9.4) actually did address the biggest issue in my post (my post = Aug 28, 2019; 1.9.4 == Sept 19, 2020), which was them writing TB of data to storage every hour. That is an incredibly fast turn around time.

If Geth were able to run at a performance level close to that of bitcoin, Monero, or other altcoin nodes, where a spinning HDD was able to run a full node, then it can only strengthen adoption of the coin because the resources to run the node and coin now scale horizontally (2 machines = 2x faster) with hardware, rather than vertically (upgrading from platinum magic to unobtainum magic in a single machine is the only way to get more fasta).

## P.S. 

Seriously, make the leveldb files &gt; 2MB as well. Make them 400-500MB. Please. It will make things so much faster. do that and fix the over-use of fsync and you'll have a node that is near bitcoin levels of sync speed! Maybe. :p [This has been brought up before](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/15704)",ethereum,1609723209,mytwentythredditid,27,1,True,2021-01-03

Eth Stolen - Don't be like me,"Today, January 1st at 6:19:12 AM Central Time (11 hours ago as of the writing of this post), my ethereum wallet was emptied of it's balance of 4.10 Eth

Here is the transaction ID: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf01967ce5ce8ba048530f0e0c37cfd01466b05e416a82a1afe9af39151bc4e35

I feel like I am going to vomit, my stomach is deep pit.

Is there anything I can do?!


Background:
I am new to this community, not being much of a redditor either. When I made this wallet it was my first venture into crypto, I was just a kid.

I mined some eth, and built a small balance, things happened and I stopped focusing on crypto for a while. A few months ago, my interest was sparked once again, and I purchased a ledger and decided to finally secure my crypto, pulling my balances of exchanges. I had to stop at the wallet.

I was just a kid, and didn't understand the importance of security or organization, so my password was not very secure, and I had forgotten it.

Results:
For the past month I've been working off and on to guess my password, today I finally managed, however 10 hours too late. This just feels so awful and unlucky, 10 hours! 10 hours could have made all the difference! Instead I've just lost nearly all my crypto, and even worse, on the first day of a new year. I would be laughing if it wasn't so awful, because for this to happen today, almost feels poetic. Why not yesterday? Or a year ago? This just feels like a bad dream.

This is worse than just losing a few thousand dollars, it is a portion of childhood, and lately I've been really happy with where eth is going and now it turns out my seat on the wagon was an ejection seat this whole time, and it went off just as things could have turned around.

TLDR: unsecure childhood eth account is emptied just at the beginning of a new year, and I was 10 hours too late to save it.

What can I do? The cops can't help?! Is there any chance I can recover it?

Is this the future direction of ETH‚Äôs application in the US and potentially the world? Will other countries, follow Venezuela and use ETH for stocks? Why or why not?  How will this affect the price of ETH? If stocks, as one asset class, are used on ETH in the form of smart contracts, how will this affect the price of ETH as a currency?

"Thoughts on Ethereum, Commodification and Human Relationship: What Are We Really Building Here?","**TLDR**:
There are ends beyond DeFi


---


Hello fellow ethereans, I hope you don't mind me having posted this on r/ethfinance a couple days ago. Not sure how much crossover there is between the subs, and I would love to hear some feedback on my thinking here!

These thoughts were prompted by Vitalik‚Äôs lovely [Endnotes on 2020](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/12/28/endnotes.html), Ray Dillinger‚Äôs recent statement entitled ‚Äò[Bitcoin is a Disaster](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2020-December/036510.html) and some [subsequent discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/km8gzh/daily_general_discussion_december_29_2020/ghf8vt3/) in the daily, as well as the simple realization that 2020 gave us: things can get out of hand very quickly. 


Normally I wouldn‚Äôt post something like this because my idea is not fully formed, but also if I wait until the idea is fully formed I will never post it. I know this is not necessarily the best forum for such a long post, and it seems like the daily gets a lot more action here than individual posts, but I don‚Äôt write often so I don‚Äôt really have many other places to put this. 


I am extremely bullish on the price of eth denominated in USD, but one of the reasons for my bullishness is that it seems the world has an addiction to quantification, financialization and commodification. Ethereum enables this commodification, but may bring with it some negative externalities, namely increased abstraction and increased consumption. 


&amp;nbsp;


**Increased Abstraction**


This one may be pretty obvious for anyone following defi but abstraction and abstraction of abstraction is simple with ethereum. This talk entitled [Money and Debt and Digital Contracts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyaWFicSihE&amp;feature=youtu.be) from Brewster Kahle at Devcon 5 is fascinating. In it he defines debt as quantified, transferable obligation, and goes on to describe how debt is the basis of our money systems. Essentially, most money today is future value abstracted into the now. Obviously ethereum is the best place for debt to live, but soon we will have quantified, transferable everything: socks, insurance, pieces of real estate‚Ä¶ and it will all sit on top of ethereum if we are right. 


In the talk, Kahle describes the concept of the Hebrew Jubilee, which essentially de-commodified and de-abstractionized society every 50 years. What once had a price (in the form of debt owed): land, crops, future years of servitude, etc was definancialized as a way of stabilizing society. This release valve was built as a peaceful way of avoiding societal turmoil. Kahle even points out that every civil war during the period studied leading up to the time of Jubilee was a debt war. If we are dealing with a tool that makes it much more simple to commodify everything then we are also building an economic system that will quickly pile up abstraction. And with trustless smart contracts, it won‚Äôt be simple to reset this abstraction. Following this logic, building a more financialized society on ethereum may also be building a more socially unstable society.


As Wendell Berry says, ‚Äò[it all turns on affection](https://spiritoftheland.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/It-All-Turns-On-Affection-Wendell-Berry.pdf)‚Äô... or at it‚Äôs base, the value and longevity of a thing or place people use comes from human care for that thing, not from the fact that it was financialized or can be exchanged. Movement away from ‚Äò[the order of loving care](https://www.counterpointpress.com/dd-product/the-art-of-loading-brush/)‚Äô is especially concerning in the commodification of farmland which has gone from being controlled by generations of people who could expect their grandchildren to live on that land, to being controlled by multinational corporations with an obligation to care for the place only insofar as a profit can be extracted from it. This is not to say that the ethereum community alone has the responsibility to reverse trends of commoditization, but it should be wary of the ability to tokenize real places and further abstract their value.


Personally, I am hopeful for the new things on ethereum that may have a monetary cost to execute, but value measured in more than money. These things will not be abstractions, but real and new things (or as real as non-physical things can be). The things I am most excited about are non-financialized projects like identity systems, forms of collaboration and mutual aid. I would love to hear of more examples of non-financialized value being created on ethereum. 


&amp;nbsp;


**Increased Consumption**


The concept of [induced demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand#:~:text=Induced%20demand%20is%20demand%20that,%2Dup%22%20as%20latent%20demand.) is that when infrastructure gains more capacity, demand rises to meet that capacity. This is true with road building in the world of transportation, and we have seen this with online shopping as Amazon built out highly efficient retail infrastructure. I think for [roads](https://auto.howstuffworks.com/air-pollution-from-cars.htm#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20EPA%2C%20motor,percent%20of%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions) and [Amazon](https://depts.washington.edu/sctlctr/news-events/in-the-news/hidden-environmental-cost-amazon-prime%E2%80%99s-free-fast-shipping) the unsustainable results of increased infrastructure capacity are obvious. If ethereum is a novel and vastly improved infrastructure of value, then surely there are some unforeseen real world implications for this new capacity. In transportation, a recent response to some of the negative externalities caused by highway infrastructure (congestion, high maintenance costs, long commute times) has been to [destroy them completely](https://www.cnu.org/publicsquare/2017/07/06/freeway-fill-feeds-urban-revival). I am not suggesting we shut down ethereum before the party even gets started, but I am suggesting some of the most valuable things that could get built on ethereum are not more efficient ways of commoditizing and financializing things in order to serve human consumption patterns.


&amp;nbsp;


**Making Ethereum More Human**


Because of my concerns regarding abstraction and consumption, I hope that we are able to use ethereum to do more than defi, which so far seems to just be a (much) more efficient tool for financialization. As Vitalik alluded to in his discussion of the changing role of economics in ‚ÄòEndnotes on 2020‚Äô, economies seem to be eating politics and notions of democratic processes‚Ä¶ or maybe more broadly, ‚Äòmoney is eating the world‚Äô. Related listening is this compelling discussion from Yanis Varoufakis: [Is Capitalism Devouring Democracy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGeevtdp1WQ&amp;t) (I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with his approach btw). If eth is ‚Äò[programmable money](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-next-money-upgrade), though, then maybe we should be careful of what it‚Äôs eating. 


Ethereum can allow relationship-less transactions, which is good for achieving certain tasks, but we should remember it is good to be trusted and to trust. If you don‚Äôt have some level of vulnerability to and trust in another person, you don‚Äôt have relationship. Blockchains allow for ‚Äòtrustless transactions‚Äô - and when they do, they make us rely on fewer humans for our daily needs. Blockchains are absolutely a fantastic alternative to centralized intermediaries (like banks and big tech firms) meeting our needs, but they are also not a replacement for human relationship. If a trustless blockchain (or other impersonal piece of infrastructure like Amazon or a highway) can achieve what we want, public discourse can become more divided and alienating because we need to cooperate with fewer and fewer people to survive. Eric Klinenberg has a fantastic discussion of what he calls ‚Äòsocial infrastructure‚Äô in the physical world in his book [Palaces for the People](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557044/palaces-for-the-people-by-eric-klinenberg/). Vitalik also hit on this sentiment in his year end post, in his discussion of ‚Äòdigital nationalism‚Äô. I hope that ethereum can enable trustless transactions where they are helpful, but also that it can help us remove trust in centralized third parties and grow trust in the people we know and who live nearby to us, a kind of ‚Äò**economic** social infrastructure‚Äô. I think that human connection, collaboration and relationship still holds serious value in making the world turn, and I hope we don‚Äôt forget it.",ethereum,1609607640,crandallberries,66,1,True,2021-01-02
I have a short but important question about ethereum before I get into mining it," 

Hi, I hope you guys are doing well today. I just wanted to know some of the good reasons to get into Ethereum mining and some of the downsides. I am asking this because a close friend of mine brought up a good point that might change my mine on whether or not to start mining.

Is cryptocurrency mining moral? He is afraid that I am ensuring and securing the currency used by drug lords and underground pedo rings. Is this true? I mean, if it is something small like less than one percent of one percent of transactions are like this then that is somewhat okay as stuff like that is unavoidable. But, if most transactions are buying things that are objectively wrong like ordering hits and pedo films, then I do not want to be apart of it and mine Ethereum.

What do you think about this? I still want to mine but this might be a deal breaker for me. Is there a good estimate of what Ethereum is used for and how much of it is used to pay for those objectively bad things and how much of it is used for more legitimate reasons. I am curious and I want to hear your opinion.",ethereum,1609608087,Brilliant-Ad-7834,6,1,True,2021-01-02

Help a noob out - questions about setting up recurring buys (dca) and about ETH staking,"Hi! I have two questions that I've been googling for a few days without finding any good solutions or clear answers, so I thought I'd ask reddit. I hope this is the right forum :)

First, I've decided that I'd like to save some of my salary every month in BTC and ETH - I'm thinking about 20 euro in each crypto. I'd like to set this up as a recurring buy, preferably so that 40-50 euro gets deducted from my account every month when I get paid. With this money, I buy 5 euro of BTC and 5 euro of ETH every week. I hope there's a solution out there that lets me set it and forget it - I'm not looking to daytrade, I'd like to let this run for a few years and see where it goes. If I lose it all, I'll live; if I break even, that's cool; and if I'm set for life with several sports cars, well, then that's pretty cool too. Coinbase has a recurring buy option, but their fees are pretty ridiculous, especially for the small amounts I would like to buy. Also, I've seen that people around here don't like coinbase very much, so I'm wondering if there are any other options available. I'm in Norway and prefer paying with my credit or debit card instead of using bank transfer. (PS: After reading a little, I feel BTC and ETH are the safest choices for a long term savings plan like this, but please let me know if you have any suggestions for other suitable coins). 

Second, I bought 1.5 ETH several years ago, and it was a nice surprise to see that it's worth a little more now than when I bought it. Still, it's not very much, and I don't really need it for the foreseeable future, so it will probably just stay in my wallet for at least a few more years before I cash it out anyway. I've seen that I can choose to stake it in a staking pool for ETH 2.0 to gain interest on it, but I don't really understand what this means. Do any of you have any advice on whether I should or shouldn't do this? Why (not)? And if yes, where and how?",ethereum,1609613171,sjakkpila,0,1,True,2021-01-02

What are your thoughts on creating a S.A.F.E company (Sustainable Autonomous Financial Enterprise),"The premise of this idea struck me after reading about an article about this website called Pornhub (never heard of it before until reading this article sksksk), converting to crypto only payments to run their business. Similarly, we saw a similar instance with Spencer Dinwiddie (NBA player) tokenizing his contract and Russell Okung (NFL Player) accepting his payment in Bitcoin. So this got me to offer up this question, late at night, half dazed on the NYE resolutions:

‚Äú&gt; What is a term we can coin for businesses or people  that want to be fully financially decentralized?
&gt; For example, when it comes to companies promoting sustainability. You have businesses being carbon-neutral, water positive, solar powered etc..
&gt; We need a term like that, but for companies who want to be financially decentralized‚Äù

That‚Äôs what sparked this theory crafted session on this discord. Discord user justin bebis, offered up the term ‚ÄúSustainable Autonomous Financial Enterprise or SAFE. We know it sounds dumb, but it‚Äôs some what marketable‚Äù, he says

What would be included into a SAFE? 

Well for starters a company that chooses to default to crypto only payment solutions.

Another consideration that could be added was

‚Äú I also like the idea of having completely decentralized companies, similar to what Aragon is doing‚Äù - Cl√©ment

[Setup screen for tornado.cash anonymity mining](https://preview.redd.it/sdlx0pegqr861.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e55e3a5226cbb42f8e867de651c84dd6f87af83)

1. Why do I need the recovery key? What does it recover? I'm used to the keys I get for using [tornado.cash](https://tornado.cash) that I can then redeem elsewhere for that amount, but where does this come into it? Do I use this when I recover a code? Do I use this after I've recovered a code? At the destination account? At the creation account? Anywhere?
2. How does on-chain backup of the key work? Is it somehow encrypted so that only the wallet I created it with can read it?
3. Why does the on-chain recovery not work with a hardware wallet (at least that is what it says)? How does that make a difference? I was thinking of maybe trying this with a Ledger.

Interactive App,"Unfortunately, Ethereum isnt as easy to explain as bitcoin, and so I keep hearing how Ethereum is hard to fully grasp/explain by no coiners so why not SHOW people why Ethereum is great?

Someone should build (Im not a programmer/coder) an application that introduces Ethereum to interested people! The project will take visitors through a series of steps that will introduce them to Ethereum and some of the endless possibilities they can do!

&amp;#x200B;

The demo, which is interactive and the user will have to press and use an app just like any other user, will take them from uniswap to compound to maker. Maybe even yield farm and register an ENS name! The idea is for newbies to understand how Ethereum composable Ethereum is and how everything works together and with each other! Hell you can even show them how they can tokenize their house, use part of it as collateral to then buy stocks? Ofcourse its all an interactive presentation and its not real Eth/money the user is dealing with.

Could having to pay gas fees prevent mass adoption of ethereum?,"I'm very new to this, but also very excited by the potential. My first experience has been with trying to mint some art work into NFTs.

My first impression is that just to ""post"" something on an ethereum dapp, I have to pay anywhere between $15 - $50.

These prices are just insane to do very small things, and the mass public would much rather do things on regular centralized apps if it means not having to pay.

My only experience is in making NFTs so maybe minting things is just expensive and I'm unaware of other things that can be done on ethereum.

Unpopular Opinion: ETH needs to be simple to understand if you want adoption any time soon.,"The advantages that DEFI and smart contracts have for the leveling up of our society are undeniable, but most people aren't technically profficient enough for it to be practical for them. 

In my own layman's opinion, the best way to approach this is to incentivize businesses to use smart contracts. Doing business over blockchain would help shift crypto from being a highly volitile asset that most people only hold hoping for profit, to a store of value that is actually logical to exchange hands. 

I think adoption on the firm level must come before general population. There is no reason for 99.9% of people to have eth if they can't pay bills, shop online, or buy groceries with eth. 

Also, eth needs to be usable for people who don't understand computers and networks on a deep level .... Because most people don't.

Are there any projects going on that are using eth to create business applications?

More secretEther users needed! Privacy fans unite.,"So The Secret Network Ethereum bridge is live. 

First off I am not affiliated with The Secret Network. I'm an advocate for privacy and have used [tornado.cash](https://tornado.cash) since inception. This is another option for Ether privacy, cheaper but more complicated that tornado.

There is currently 148 ETH locked which means that right now it is not that secret, we need a larger pool for more privacy. Whole Ether amounts increase the anonymity set as well  (0.1,1,2,3,etc.). It's great to see different projects improving privacy on Ethereum (even if it is cross chain!)

Should I stake?,"Hi everyone, I think this is the most suited sub to ask this on.

Should I stake my ETH? I don't have 32 ETH (Not in the slightest) but I use Kraken and kraken supports staking ETH with &lt; 32 ETH. Kraken even lets me unstake my ETH (sort of) by creating a trading pair for Staked ETH and unstaked ETH. This seems really interesting and it would reward me with a couple bucks each month. Now here come the big questions:

* Is there any risk in losing my ETH (partially or entirely) by staking it on Kraken?

The next question is Kraken related but here it goes:

* Am I able to transfer the rewards earned by staking ETH to regular ETH using the trading pair?

Eth 2.0 Fair Value Calculation Suggestion,"As we get closer and closer to EIP1559 and ETH2.0 coming out I have a simple suggestion for a way to get an estimated fair value of Ether and want your opinions on it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Eth2.0 with EIP1559 without Shards**

I am assuming that Eth2.0 without Shards, with Eth1 merged into the beacon chain has the same TPS as Eth1

|Transactions Per Second (TPS)|13|
|:-|:-|
|Transactions per year (TPY)|409 968 000|
|Fee per transaction (FPT)|2 USD|
|Staking rewards per Year| 224394 Eth|

TPY\*FPT/StakingRewards = EthPrice

(409 968 000 \* 2) / 224394 = 3654 USD

This would be the price where Eth stops being deflationary with the current Fee per tx, Transactions per year and staking rewards.

If we get 10 Million Eth staked it changes to 1673 USD

&amp;#x200B;

When shards are added the Tps is increased dramatically but Tx fee will most likely fall dramatically too so the total fee burn might stay similar in the beginning until more projects start up as a result of the lower fees and increased adoption. When adoption increases deflation also increases until reaching an equilibrium at a certain price.",ethereum,1609064552,Skretch12,38,1,True,2020-12-27

I'm new to Ethereum but need to implement some serious production-ready smart contract.

But in my case, I need to forward that money to my own wallet but can't do it without a gas which users don't send to the generated wallet.

Interesting Question / Discussion on Flashloans offered by dydX and others...,"Hello all,

I'm trying to wrap my head around the concept of flashloans. Would the following use case be possible, and if so wouldn't this be a huge flaw in future practical use of a cryptocurrency?

USE CASE:

1. A ""credit card"" like IOT device be built that executes a flashloan to fund IRL purchases of goods (food, clothes, etc...)
2. The user of the device receives the goods as the funds are successfully deposited into the merchants wallet(and then the user consumes the goods or leaves the premise)
3. The transaction is reverted and the merchant does not actually receive any payment due to the flashloan defaulting

Would the merchant be out of luck in this scenario or am I overthinking this?

EIP 1559: Potential for a Layer 1 Public Goods Funding Mechanism?,"Proposal: 

What if a portion of the BASEFEE under EIP-1559 was put towards funding public goods and on-chain development rather than having 100% burned.  Instead, say 50% went towards funding public goods (which could even be matched under a quadratic funding model - potentially even by the protocol itself, though this would introduce inflation), with the remaining 50% BASEFEE burned.

Issues:

The main issue I see with this is that it introduces the question of 'which public goods to fund' and, more importantly, *who decides* this.  Essentially this would require some sort of on-chain governance, which normally I would maintain should not be implemented at the Layer 1 protocol level -- however, if it was restricted to ONLY determining which external public goods to fund and nothing to do with on-chain economics or the functioning of the protocol itself...

What is the future of ERC-721?,"As we all know, ERC-721 are the Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) that represent digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain.

I think the future of Ethereum-based collectibles is massive, yet I'm struggling to see the market at scale. How will sharding and ETH2.0 affect ERC-721? Are we expected to exit ERC-721 tokens to layer-2 solutions?

If a game developer wants to process billions of unique digital assets per month and leverage an open network protocol like ETH2.0, is there a way they'll be able to do it in a cost effective manner?

One of the biggest milestones I hear about crypto is beating Visa (tx/s &gt; 65k) - will this include ERC721/ERC20, and will ETH2.0 also bring their cost down?

I'm patient, but having familiarized myself with Nethereum, and being a long time 721 fan since the CK days, I'm wanting to see how I can help push the envelope on this rather than just sitting around and waiting for the network to happen.

Noob Developer Question Regarding the Logic of Dapps &amp; Smart Contracts.,"Hi there,

While I've tinkered a little, I am not a professional developer in the conventional software space. Thus trying to reframe my head around Dapp logic is doing my head in. I have a question that isn't coding related, but more about the logic of smart contracts and interacting with them. I'm hoping someone could help.

**Okay, so here's the scenario and question.**

* There's a very simple Dapp. All it does is list people on a register + outline the protocols (1) to allow you to get on the register and (2) benefits when you are on the register.
* A public client-side will allow people to view this register.
* A simple smart contract will add people to the register, along with a few properties of the newly added people.
* **BUT THE QUESTION IS: How do I, or can I, stop third parties calling the smart contract and effectively adding (random) people to the register whenever they want?**

My understanding was that any respectable project will make their smart contracts public &amp; verifiable (perhaps even able to be decompiled).

*So what is the logic that should be used to make sure that it's not possible for anyone to call the smart contract and erroneously add people to the 'register'?*

**What am I missing here?**

Thanks, in advance, for any advice. Plus I hope you don't mind if I cut &amp; paste this question into another sub.

Fake Uniswap Liquidity or How to Make 5 ETH in 20 mins,"Everyone knows to watch out for fake tokens on Uniswap, but marketing a fake token and setting up a bunch of social accounts in an attempt to get people to buy your fake tokens is a lot of work! Luckily this is the blockchain; it turns out you don't even need to market your new token to get people to buy it as there are already folks waiting to buy your new token at low, low prices.

Take this account for example: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x515f197a769893befb4388d3db087e311bd1b2b5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x515f197a769893befb4388d3db087e311bd1b2b5)

They create a fake contract with some dot-finance token name (maybe these are real shitcoin names, who knows), add \~15 ETH worth of liquidity and their newly minted tokens, wait for the price to go up as others buy the token and then promptly remove their liquidity at the new price of 1.3x what they put in. Bam, easy money. Make a new address, move some of your eth, deploy a new contract and start again. It takes less than an hour usually and in this case just 20 minutes to make 5 ETH.

But how do you find people to buy your new fake token?

Here's where the interesting part comes in: people are always watching the blockchain for ways to make money, and one of those ways is watching new tokens that get deployed and get fresh liquidity injections on uniswap (method signature \`0xf305d719\`). In a neutral world this is a great plan, get in on new tokens before everyone else can catch on, get first dibs on new tokens and then sell when the masses arrive via the official token marketing push. But the market isn't neutral and clearly people deploy fake contracts and provide them with fake liquidity to take advantage of people who think they're getting in early.

So the new contract markets itself... even if no one actually believes it's for a real purpose.

Do the token buyers actually care about the token? Are they bots or simply people trying to make a quick buck as part of someone else's scheme? Who knows. Usually they're left holding the bag, it's not a business I would encourage anyone to get in, even if you think you're fast.",ethereum,1608667660,ethhax,11,1,True,2020-12-22

Why would there need to be a currency (like ETH) in the first place or is the entire argument about having a currency that is decentralized and that's it?

Can I create this* smart contact on the ethereum blockchain?,"\*a smart contract which will allow a group of investors to invest in a real estate business.

The idea is, a 'organiser' aka, a Ltd company incorporated by myself develops a smart contract on a popular blockchain such as Ethereum. Investors will pledge a target amount (eg $200k), and the organiser will present a range of real estate properties for the investors to vote upon for purchase. The property will then generate revenue from traditional leasing agreements and then distributed to investors accordingly, and hopefully the rise in property value. With on-going voting on various aspects of the management of the property.

The smart contract will promote trust, remove some significant risks, as well as giving people the chance to expose investments in real estate for lower minimums than ever seen before.

BUCC - privacy token on Ethereum allowing transactions which not showing on etherscan,"Buccaneer V2 (BUCC) is a working privacy token on Ethereum. There‚Äôs rudimentary proof on the etherscan, https://etherscan.io/token/0xd5a7d515fb8b3337acb9b053743e0bc18f50c855 

&gt; *Etherscan don't show Holders and Transactions, as they don't exists but, in fact, they're existing and, moreover, confirmed by Ethereum decentralized consensus.*

But that‚Äôs just sort of a band aid that they figured out how to hide balances. The real privacy comes through the **Bermuda API**, when you send a transaction (https://buccapi.eth), make sure you have metamask or some other web3 friendly wallet format available for it.

For now, BUCC is the number one privacy solution and its market cap is around only 200k right now, barely marketed and barely heard about.

It gets sweeter though, a lot of lovely folks like to claim you can track TXs through an Ethereum node by scooping up all interacted with addresses, but with the private wallet and GSN, you can self-whitelist through the private wallet. **Right now, sending a transaction through BUCC‚Äôs api is 100% private and it‚Äôs API is serverless and literally BUCC, it is a smart contract.**

Need a feedback for a new Dapp,"Hello community,

We made a [Dapp](https://kool.lol/) dedicated to the Kool-Aid drink. The idea behind is the ability to collect a variety of flavors and mix cocktails from them. The ERC-1155 smart-contract is responsible for this. We'd like to hear you feedback and invite you to our smooth community. 

What is it?

The Kool Bar is powered by 2 tokens: KOOL and AID. KOOL is the main token with the fixed supply tradable on [Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xda15087ec9a8460e2e52504d0757a154a158b913). AID is a supplementary inflationary token which [can be farmed](https://kool.lol/farm/) by staking KOOL and KOOL/ETH LP tokens.

[The Kool Bar](https://kool.lol/bar) includes NFT flavors of different rarity: Common, Uncommon, Rare and Super Rare. Flavors are seasonal, however some may reappear as mixing ingredients in the future seasons.

Common flavors are being sold for AID. Uncommon, Rare and Super Rare can only be obtained via mixing. Common flavors are the very foundation of the Kool Bar as no cocktails can be mixed without them. You‚Äôd better possess several NFTs of each common flavor, if you want to complete the whole season collection. Each time you mix a new cocktail its ingredients‚Äô NFTz get burnt and therefore become scarcer. In some scenarios certain Common flavors may become even scarcer than Rare ones!

That's it! Anyway, check out the website and claim Zero flavor NFT for free (only gas to spend).",ethereum,1608470922,undwrtr,3,1,True,2020-12-20

How to fund Formality? Ideas and thoughts related to Ethereum,"I've been researching my options to fund the [Formality](https://github.com/moonad/formality) project. For those that don't know, Formality is a programming language that was initially developed at the Ethereum Foundation, with the goal of making smart-contracts safer using formal proofs. When the foundation announced the separation of some internal teams, I was possibly the first to ask to leave, because I judged the project was shifting away from being Ethereum-centered, and I wanted freedom to explore other areas without being a cost for the Ethereum Foundation. Since then, we've been funding its development with our own resources. We could keep doing so indefinitely, but there are many cool projects that we'd like to take that would require hiring more people, and we don't have the resources for that.

While I could look for investors in a traditional setting, I don't feel like Formality is really a project that fits the usual startup lifecycle. Trying to find ways to profit will shift our priorities, and we'll end up developing things that are profitable for us, but not necessarily as cool for the community. For example, developing a mature, market-ready, massively parallel compiler for functional programming languages based on interaction nets is something I've been dying to do for years, is costly, but would never be in the scope of a conventional startup.

I have, though, this little idea on my mind. The plan is: I'll create a quadratic token for Formality. That is, in order to buy the `nth` token, you must pay `n * k` Ether. That token will not be a merely ""funding"" token, like Gitcoin, but more like a stock, in the sense token holders will have access to several benefits such as being able to demand features, to consult the team, and having part of the profit of any eventual for-profit app we develop in a future.

The reason I think such token would work great is that it would allow us to have the flexibility to shift between for-profit and non-profit developments, raising on demand, without having the immediate pressure that an ICO would bring. In other words, I believe the price of the token would be more honest, reflecting, in ""real time"", the overall interest and projected profitability of our project. It would be as if we had a stock, except at much smaller scales. If we don't do anything remarkable or profitable, there will be no increased interest, the token would just have a constant (possibly 0) value, and nobody would ""feel scammed"". Great! If we announce some cool app that turns out to be profitable, or if the community just decides to invest in us, the token would immediately rise in value as people seek to have a share of these profits, and we'd have the resources to execute such project. IMO it seems to be the most ""mathematically correct"" to fund our team.

"I made a fantasy trading card game, with AI generated character arts","[https://etheroes.io](https://etheroes.io)

A bit of history: The idea of the cards started when I saw how an AI could generate realistic photos of people. I tried to apply the same techniques to generating fantasy characters, and got amazing results.

The next 2 weeks were spent on designing the card assets, hero traits and descriptions. I borrowed some ideas from D&amp;D (attribute points and alignment). Also threw in a random name generator, of which the names were scraped all over the internet.

Once I had the card assets, the rest all fell in place. It was obvious that Ethereum was the best market place for such a collectible game. I spent the next 2 weeks writing the smart contract (based on ERC 721) and various pieces to support trading on the site. Fun fact: ETH price took off right before I was ready to deploy the contract on the mainnet. Due to high gas price, I had to spent a fortune... not fun!

BTW, why didn't I use ERC 1155? I had planned for more types of assets in the game, so it seems ERC 1155 would be a better choice. The problem is it's very awkward to use the ERC 1155 interface if your main focus is pure NFTs. Maybe I'm still missing something. Oh well, I'll figure it out later.

For a limited time, the cards will be free to claim. But good luck with the transaction fees lol.",ethereum,1608308511,waitthisiswrong,15,15,True,2020-12-18

He rushed a simple copy paste, mistakenly sending his entire LINK holdings (the great majority of his on-chain savings) to the GHST staking contract he‚Äôd previously interacted with instead of to the Binance deposit address he‚Äôd intended. 

With crypto, there is no undo button and those LINK are irretrievably stuck in the non-upgradeable [GHST staking contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x93ea6ec350ace7473f7694d43dec2726a515e31a).

Many of us have had our own learning experiences with crypto, and this can easily be shrugged off as another case of ‚Äúlesson learned.‚Äù BUT just because this situation is not amendable on a technical level, doesn‚Äôt mean we as a community, in the spirit of charity and goodwill, can‚Äôt do something kind for this poor chap.

That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve set up a SantaGotchi Wallet. On Christmas day we will be transferring whatever has been deposited in this wallet to Dawid, a father, GotchiGang member and Link Marine.

&gt;***SantaGotchi.eth***

Any little bit can help, let‚Äôs show our humanity this holiday season and try to help take the edge off for Dawid, even if just a bit.

"üîâ Aleph.im, a decentralized cloud project compatible with Ethereum, is launching its staking program","Aleph.im‚Äôs mission is to help decentralized apps and protocols **strip off the centralized parts of their stack, achieving a fully decentralized architecture**. It achieves this by providing decentralized databases (including file storage), computation and a decentralized identification (DID) framework. *You can think of aleph.im as a decentralized AWS or firebase.*

Aleph.im is already compatible with Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos and more. With this launch it will be able to accommodate larger DApps (i.e. NFT-related DApps needing a lot of storage space for their NFT Metadata).

Aleph.im did not do an ICO, nor any private sale round or such. You can see the project's track record,  and future roadmap on the medium blog, twitter and website.

Nuf said. For all those interested to stake or run a node, here is an article series to get you started:

Dai Hard - A Christmas challenge,"An explosion rocks Serenity City.

In the aftermath a message is anonymously dropped onto an obscure cypherpunk mailing list.

    It is unfortunate that your elected officials were not able to meet my most reasonable demands.
    
    Perhaps now they will see that 10 million Dai would have been the least costly option after all.
    
    Thankfully for them, I believe that everyone deserves a second chance.
    
    I have planted another bomb in Serenity City, this time a dirty bomb containing radioactive material.
    
    After block 11525000 the bomb will be triggered.
    
    Merry Christmas, old friends.  

The SCPD manage to locate the bomb, but find themselves unable to disarm or move it due to a selection of anti-tampering measures protecting the device.

In desperation they post a reward contract for its successful deactivation:

[Bomb disposal contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x673fd2220c495d4fe5ef91d65f5689d95f7a72d1#code)

Is there anyone out there able to bypass the anti-tampering, cut the right wires and then disarm the bomb?

[ETH2] Delay in attestation can save a validator from slashing?,"I'm still digging, and probably I'm wrong, but it seems to me more like a *hole* in the specs.

Few hours ago [validator 1644](https://beaconcha.in/validator/1644) was slashed for attesting the same slot with different content. This time though, [that false attestation was signed by 4 validators](https://beaconcha.in/block/102389#attester-slashings) but only one was slashed.

Looking at data it seems to me that the slashed one did a ""wrong attestation"" on time, while the other three were out of sync with the network and it seems their votes were not counted for slot 102388. 

Few minutes later then, those three validators got rewarded for the same false attestation because it was included in slot 102391. They got payed 1/3 of normal reward because of delay, but they was payed and they are still validating now without problems.

Because there is no errors and it seems the consensus is reached among all the clients out there, this lead me to think it can be a bug in the spec (or maybe a ""feature"" that I still don't understand well).

Kleros hands over governance to the Kleros Governor smart contract,"On the 9th of December 2020, Kleros protocol has been fully decentralized with control over all smart contract changes handed over to the Kleros Governor. 

Any changes made to core contracts powering the Kleros ecosystem will need to be voted on and executed via community vote using PNK. This is a huge moment in the development of Kleros creating a fully autonomous platform under the full control of community members and PNK holders. ¬†

Until now, Kleros had been using Aragon Governance to vote on proposals made to change parameters or functions within the Kleros protocol and dapp suite. The results of those would be ‚Äòtrusted‚Äô with the Cooperative to implement.

With the implementation of the Governor, all proposal votes will be automatically executed by the governor smart contract.

Are there more traditional user experiences for betting on sports with Ethereum?,"It seems like the only sports betting you can do with Ethereum is some markets on Augur.

"In MoonDefi , the seller sends the asset to the core contract before calling the swap function.","In MoonDefi , the seller sends the asset to the core contract before calling the swap function. Then, the contract measures how much of the asset it has received, by comparing the last recorded balance to its current balance. This means the core contract is agnostic to the way in which the trader transfers the asset. Instead of transferFrom, it could be a meta transaction or any other future mechanism for authorizing the transfer of ERC-20s.

Also, once I have bought some ethereum, Is there a way I can easily check how much I have etc, like I would on my regular banking app for example.

Effects of potential stablecoin dominance for value transfer transactions,"I've been trying to think through the impact of stablecoins on the ethereum market and economy, and I wanted to get everyone's thoughts. Since the value of USD is fairly stable and reliable (I know there's still risk of inflation and stuff... let's just assume that it will continue to be a solid currency for most uses), I could imagine a future where mainstream adoption occurs but almost everyone just holds and transacts in USD stablecoins, instead of ETH.

What incentives are there to use base ETH over stablecoins for most applications? And is there anything stopping the ethereum economy from just becoming a back-end foundational infrastructure on which a much large stablecoin economy runs?

Would stablecoin dominance stall ETH price? Would it disrupt any other aspects of the market? Would it disrupt the vision of ethereum?

Geth v1.9.25 release - Marljeh,"Geth v1.9.25 is a maintenance release.

Notable changes in this release:

- Geth has a new subcommand, `geth version-check`, which displays known security issues ([#21859](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21859))
- The geth `--ws.origins` flag now supports more expressive origin rules ([#21481](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21481))
- Recording of trie key preimages can now be disabled using the `--cache.preimages` flag ([#21402](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21402))
- The accounts/abi/bind package now offers replay-protected transaction signing ([#21356](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21356))
- The GraphQL API now always returns status code 400 if there is an error processing the query ([#21882](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21882))
- The `devp2p nodeset filter` command can now find snap-enabled nodes ([#21950](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21950))
- The eth protocol test suite has been extended with tests for transaction announcements and malicious announce behavior ([#21857](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21857), [#21792](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21792))
- Support for 'retesteth' has been removed from geth since it is no longer used for tests. Its replacement, the `evm t8n` tool, was released in Geth v1.9.16 ([#21861](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21861))
- We now offer signify/minisign signatures for Geth binary downloads as an alternative to PGP. This is experimental, and not yet advertised on the downloads page ([#21798](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21798))

Bug fixes:

Pi Network Is a new developing crypto app which you can mine from your phone for free.
It right now has a audience of 10 million users and is now planning to create blockchains and wallets in 2021.
I Highly recommend you check it out since you have pretty much nothing to lose since its free and all you have to do is come to the app once a day and press the mining button it wont affect your battery or ram.
If you are still sketched out please go over and check their white paper out.
They give a clear vivid description of their vision and how their going to try and achieve such a milestone for the crypto market.

I'm curious about EXACTLY how POS works with regard to hardware...

Seems to me that hardware is still needed in some capacity to process transactions on the chain.

This has been always confused me when people talk about the end of POW...

 * Other than pointing my rigs at alt Coins surely there's a way to convert my systems to be part of the proof of stake Network? 

* Other than suggesting that I mine some other coin, can anyone clarify how GPU rigs can be repurposed (software or hardware) to still be used?

* in theory if EVERY coin has been mined does that end the hardware wing of blockchain and decentralized finance?

* if every coin is minted... and all of them switch over to POS, how is that decentralized Finance? surely the whole world over of mining hardware ends and we end up with a small number of ASIC devices controlling everything... no?",ethereum,1607541630,apples_to_peaches,27,1,True,2020-12-09

Here are the details about our DEX, rewards, etc:

You will learn about the foundational problem of distributed computing, Consensus, that is key to create blocks securely.Five skill-based training modules will help boost your career and technical skills, including: 1 - Consensus in Blockchain: Learn the basics on blockchain abstraction and the importance of consensus between machines in order to mitigate the risks of having an attacker spend the same asset twice - an undesirable situation called 'double-spending', 2 - Blockchain Fundamentals: Understand failures and delays blockchain systems must consider, and how these events may prevent machines from reaching Consensus., 3 - Consensus Fundamentals: Investigate how to solve consensus when failures cannot occur in the network. Later on, then learn how to solve consensus when processes may fail, first through crash failures and then when processes can behave arbitrarily, 4 - Making Blockchains Secure: Understand how delays in the network can impact the security of the Blockchain by using network attacks that allow hackers to steal digital assets in the past and that every Blockchain designer should be aware of., and 5 - Making Blockchains Scale: Design a scalable and secure Blockchain algorithm. What makes a Blockchain algorithm scalable and secure? This requires a consensus algorithm that works over the Internet and is not affected by unexpected communication delays.

Where do you store your 24-word seed? Need suggestions to improve my security of funds in a non-custodial account," I have a 24-word seed from EarnBet-an online decentralized casino with which I have a decent amount of $BET staked. I wrote the phrase on a piece of paper.¬† I then decided to write it on a password program like lastpass/keepass.¬† So in order to get into the lastpass, you need a password.¬† And i put the lastpass in dropbox/google drive and store it there.¬† My thought was if someone somehow hacked into my Gmail/dropbox, well they still need the password to my lastpass in order to get into my EarnBet seed.¬† I put the EarnBet seed in there as I type it out along with my other bank account details and other financial information. 

So I only have the seed written on a piece of paper which I have in the house.¬† But of course, things could happen like fire, floods, etc.¬† So what is the best way to store your seed to prevent this?¬† Did I heard of cryptosteel where it's fireproof and floodproof so that works?¬† But isn't the issue if someone finds it, well it's pretty easy to see oh why is there a bunch of long words and some ppl might even figure out it's the seed of a wallet?

Now if you write the seed in a notebook with a ton of stuff there, well that would be hard for someone to find.¬† Imagine like you have a notebook where you have the seed there but also in the first few pages write down like nursery school rhyme or children books and lot of stuff like that, well obviously it won't look like its important.

Also, I hear ppl say break your seed into two or three parts.¬† That makes sense but do you leave all the parts in the same house/apartment?¬† You hear about how you give one half to someone else you trust, you keep the second half.¬† Well what if you no longer see the other person anymore or something happens, then what?¬† Obviously, you would need to immediately send your coins to a temporary wallet in the meantime.",ethereum,1607238094,BeenBags362,1,1,True,2020-12-05

Mechanism to travel through blockchain historical state,"I'm looking for a way to set my ganache (or node or infura or anything) environment so that it is set pointing to a paricular block number and then allow me to run a series of view contract executions (no update of ethereum state) primarily run uniswap pair price analysis and kyber price analysis, then increment the block, and then run the same series of view contract executions.

&amp;#x200B;

The purpose is really to just gain historical price information

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen for uniswap you potentially can get the price information using the subgraph ([https://www.reddit.com/r/UniSwap/comments/jfx8a6/getting\_historical\_data\_1h\_data\_from\_subgraph/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/UniSwap/comments/jfx8a6/getting_historical_data_1h_data_from_subgraph/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)), which is what [https://info.uniswap.org/home](https://info.uniswap.org/home) to fetch its historical data. But my preference would be to be able to actually set the ethereum state and updte to make it more generic across different exchanges or contracts.

I also don't quite know if i've got anything I could for kyber

&amp;#x200B;

After doing a bit of research, the closest thing I can think of:

1. Fork main net using ganache CLI and set the block number i wish to start at

2. Run pair and contract view methods for uniswap and kyber

3. Fetch the next block number details from infura ()

4. find a method or way that allows me to add the block to the ganache local fork (fingers cross this exists and is not too complicated to do)

5. Repeat from step 2

DeFI question,"Hi, wasn't sure in which sub to post that question so i'm gonna try here, sorry if it's a stupid question or wrong place.

So i started looking at Defi and the pros and cons and all that, being relatively new to crypto and so far mostly just buying and holding on a hardware wallet. 

My question is let's say i have 1 eth, that i want to earn compound interest on. I need to exchange it for DAI or cDAI or any other, and i earn 8% interest for a year let's say. 

At the end of that year, I want eth back, but the price of eth went up 20% that year...did i miss out on those extra 12%, or am i missing something. 

Possibly my cDAI token = 1 eth, so when i convert it back to eth it's still 1 eth...now worth 20% more than before. If that's the case then great, makes sense to me.

That's what's confusing me and i couldn't find a straight explanation online.

Extremely noobish question about how to use keys to reclaim lost ethereum,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

Just started mining eth and am finally at my first payout. Nanopool initially recommended the Mist wallet so I go to check it and nothing (other than a sync that never ends). I do some research, find out mist wallet is no longer a thing. What now?

I have my keys written down and I also have a Trezor hardwallet.  So two questions:

1. Is that ethereum that was supposed to go to my mist wallet gone forever? I'm pretty sure it is not, since I have my keys. In that case, how do I use those keys to reclaim the ethereum? Or am I just screwed?
2. Is there a way to mine directly to my hardwallet? if not, what do you recommend I mine to instead of Mist?

Thank you so much guys.",ethereum,1607060285,Wellhereiam2018,4,1,True,2020-12-03

Why it is a good thing Jun Hasegawa left OMG network,"What was omg network? It‚Äôs a concept that vitalik buterin and joseph poon come up with. It‚Äôs a project we invest in based on certain claims what was made by Jun Hasegawa

&gt; OmiseGO is building a decentralized exchange, liquidity provider mechanism, clear- inghouse messaging network, and asset-backed blockchain gateway. OmiseGO is not owned by any single one party.

First paragraph from the white paper. OmiseGO is not owned by any single one party. Funny that because it was just sold by one single party 

&gt; Owning OMG tokens buys the right to validate this blockchain

Another claim from the white paper which was simply a lie. No one was aloud to validate expect Jun 

&gt; As part of the consensus rules of this network, it is required that all OMG (Omise GO) validators also run the Ethereum network to validate in parallel.

How many OMG validators was their?

&gt; In order to build this decentralized interchange network, it requires not only a blockchain well-suited for payments and interchange of issued tokens, but also a decentralized exchange which supports these activities

How did that decentralised network work out? Ended up being sold by a single entity so much for being decentralised!! 

&gt; 02/04/2018 OMG website: Big news guys: OMG and cosmos have decided to start spooning...hard. That‚Äôs right, you get a token, you get a token, everybody gets two tokens!

More lies from Jun Hasegawa 

&gt; 14/06/2020 Twitter: My company is everything for me. It‚Äôs my life

Yea so he sold out six months later because it ment everything to him

&gt; 13/05/2020 Twitter: Imagine if it‚Äôs on #OmiseGO. More Faster and cheaper. However first of all we have to tokenizing more cash into the chain. Otherwise we never get programmable money + new decentralized internet for society. Our subsidiaries connecting dots for new payment. #Synqa #Omise twitter.com/

He is clearly delusional if he thinks OMG was decentralised 

&gt; 06/06/2019 Twitter: Grow and conquer entire market, Or go home. 
Ask your self ""If you have Billion $, Are you sure you will get whole market ? That what you are doing right now?"" 
I also asked my self, ""Do i really have team that capable to lead this?""

Grow and conquer entire market or go home. Well now we not what one Jun took 

&gt; 24/5/2019 Twitter: People can‚Äôt trust Centralized party because of data utilization etc doesn‚Äôt mean people can trust decentralized apps spontaneously, Industry need to gain trust from mass people by industry credit proof and adoption with phenomenal user experience

I agree people can‚Äôt trust centralised party because they can get up and go when ever they want without a single word or explanation why

&gt; 01/08/2018 Twitter: While L2 scaling solution #Plasma and others supporting real business adoption in 2018~ , L1 (Including sharding) will ready for significant massive adoption of #Ethereum . #OmiseGO #OMG teams already helping a lot of real business to adopting this new era / tech. Matter of time

Two years and four months later ‚Äúa lot of real business‚Äù turned into two company‚Äôs 

&gt; 30/07/2018 Twitter: Crypto economics my perspective / prediction 2019 : Real business adoption / UIUX focus tools / More Dapps 
2019~2020 : #Ethereum massively scale and used by gov. We will see huge difference between real adoptable protocol and toxic speculation project.

We will see huge difference between real adoptable protocol and toxic speculation says the man who does nothing but speculate 

&gt; 16/07/2018 Twitter: One of beautiful things of blockchain space is Community engagement. I really glad to having strong #OMG #community for supporting open source OMG Network project.
Thank you for all your support. We are keep our transparent communication. #OmiseGO #Plasma

‚ÄúTransparent communication‚Äù at this point you just have to laugh. Not much communication for last two years and it definitely wasn‚Äôt Transparent what was going on behind the scenes 

&gt; 13/12/2017 Twitter: ‚ÄúUnbank the Banked‚Äù #OmiseGO #Ethereum True decentralization.

It was a central company owed by one person, sold by one person with no consulting with the community. 

&gt; 10/10/2017 Twitter: No, I'm not worry about those things. 
&gt;1. More important things is how we will make Omise acceptance and OmiseGO working seamlessly 
&gt;2. How we will transition all our customers to new generation of public chain without hustle.
&gt;3. Maintain our security on DEX network.

Point number two obviously is a lie just like most things Jun claimed. We should be great full that such a character is no longer in charge of our project. He has no leadership skills and should not be in charge of such a project with so much potential. 

OMG a concept that vitalik buterin and joseph poon come up. A project that we invested in to get started and change our world and lives. That a team built to the best of their abilities. That Jun Hasegawa sold for his own profit 

He never wrote the white paper 

He never invested in the ICO

The team built OMG network with hard work and dedication

Which Jun sold for personal profit. Good riddance. 

For the team that work night after night for a project we all wanted to succeed congratulations on everything you achieved 

For the moderators who have to deal with our moaning day after day sorry for your hardship

For Jun who continuously lied about the project and where it was headed it‚Äôs all your fault that so much complaining happened on this sub. I hope to never see your name again in the crypto space

zk-Rollups Questions,"I have been for some time now reading about the so called layer 2 solutions, and in particular, the zk-Rollups. After using some of the projects that implement this technology, I'm amazed by how fast and cheap the transactions are, but I have some technical questions that hope someone can clarify:

* How can zk-Rollups achieve that almost instant speed? I know how Bitcoin/Ethereum blockchain works, and that its speed is limited because different nodes have to talk to each other and reach consensus, which in a decentralised network takes some time. If this happens instantly in rollups like Loopring, how is this achieved? Are there some kind of nodes in l2? Can I run one? How decentralised they are? I have the feeling that things in l2 are a bit obscure and not as transparent as in l1. How is the architecture of a l2 zk-rollup?
* Some rollups like Loopring claim to be able to process around 2500 transactions per second. If we create 1000 different rollups like Loopring on l2, does this mean that we can achieve  2500 \* 1000 transactions per second in the network? Of course the bottleneck here is the current l1, and I guess this will depend on how often l2 settles the data in l1, but just wondering the parameters that can be tuned for this.

"Yesterday I asked Reddit to explain the 2.0 update, so I figured I'd try making a video explaining it!","I hope no one minds, but I know I sometimes like to listen to things instead of reading it. I will also post a TL;DW incase anyone is curious as I am. If a mod wants to remove this, no biggies! If you guys watch, I'd love some feedback on this as well, as I'm not usually too good at these types of videos!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9xY2ysEV5E&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9xY2ysEV5E&amp;feature=youtu.be)

(beware, annoying crypto shilling when I'm explaining eth. Just skip that haha.)

&amp;#x200B;

If you guys don't want to watch and are curious, my thoughts or major points everyone seemed to note was:

&amp;#x200B;

Switching to POS instead of mining which is the biggest change overall. Which means you earn eth from staking and validating the network instead of mining it. Which also with this upgrade it improves the speed, scabability, and I believe safety of the network. It also has the perk of it being better for the enviornment and allowing different types of dapps to be developed in the future. Also I believe lower gas fees on the network as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Staking is able to be done with helping validate the network with the 32 ethereum, but coinbase and I'm sure other pools will be adding pooling options to earn interest on your ethereum. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also eth 2.0 is not technically taking over eth as of now, but moreso it is STARTING the building process and building towards it, which is why there was a very big incentive for early hosters to start building and moving the network over. 

If anyone can offer more of an explaination, as in the video I was iffy on how the full on process moving over to eth 2.0 will go. From what I read it seemed like it's not fully going to transfer over yet, and is still to be determind, but I was reading where it could be the entire networked moved on in transaction, and also hearing how it'd be mimicing the ETH chain for awhile and then eventually moving on over. That was the one part even in the video I'd like more clarifcation on!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, let me know if you guys liked the video or this very quick rough type up, and if anyone wants to elaborate more for folks I'd love to hear it! Thanks for reading, and I hope no one hates me for the video post!

Looking for feedback - Delphi smart contract for Oracles,"Hello everyone,

I would like to introduce you to [Delphi](https://hashelot.com/dapps/delphi/), a smart contract for acting as Oracles which I'm beta testing on the Ropsten network.

Delphi lets anyone become - `makeMeAnOracle(uint _minimumReward)` - and play the role of an Oracle. No token needed.

Once a user has become an Oracle any other user can ask a question (limited to 32 characters) - `askTheOracle(Oracle _oracle, bytes32 _question, uint _openNum)` - if they provide a reward for the answer. The Oracle sets a minimum amount for such reward, under which no question can be asked.

Delphi's parent contract gets 0.1% of each reward.

You can play around with the interface, with the use of MetaMask, and here you can find some specs:

Solidity code: [Hashelot Delphi](https://github.com/mauponti/hashelot/blob/master/apps/ethereum/delphi/solidity/hashelot_delphi_1.0_beta.sol).

Transaction hash:
[0x275fbd...6ee4cf](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x275fbda6b04608f3eff3473eb09f3bc4ca06c921e948764007f0614dde6ee4cf).

When will be Ethereum 2.0 Usable?,"Amazing People of Ethereum community,   
I have a few missing pieces in a Ethereum 2.0. As far as i know ongoing phase is just for validators. Meaning that if you send ETH to new version of blockchain you got to lock them in your validator node for staking and this will take some time.   
My question is when will you be able to unlock ETH 2.0 and actually do something with it (meaning transactions).   
My second questions is for smart contracts on ETH 2.0. I understand that in phase 0 there will be no smart contracts. So i guessed that in phase 1 (sharding) smart contract funcionality will be implemented right ?   
Recently i ve read piece from Vitalik that Phase 2.0 might never come and i used to think that Phase 2 is a new implementation of smart contracts funcionality - so i am bit confused and would very much appreciate any information on the topic.

A plain english explanation of what the expect from Ethereum 2.0,"Seven years after Vitalik Buterin published the Ethereum whitepaper in 2013, Ethereum has evolved into a thriving financial ecosystem. In 2020, the network is on pace to settle nearly $1 trillion in annual transactions for the first time, and currently supports over $100B in assets and tens of thousands of applications. 

Despite Ethereum‚Äôs undeniable success, its aspirations are loftier still. It aims to secure a significant base of the global economy, all while remaining globally accessible to individual users at its base layer. Achieving this under Ethereum‚Äôs current throughput of 15 transactions per second is simply not feasible.  

Ethereum 2.0 is a major network upgrade, years in the making, that if successful will scale Ethereum‚Äôs throughput by more than 1,000x, without sacrificing decentralization. It will also transform the network‚Äôs native asset, ETH, by bestowing it with new properties while bringing its long term inflation rate down below 1%.  

With the numerous layer-1 competitors eying Ethereum‚Äôs market share and the recent surge in DeFi activity pushing Ethereum to its limits, the stakes could not be higher. 

The first major phase of ETH 2.0 will kick into high gear tomorrow at 12pm UTC (7am EST) with the launch of Phase 0 and the Beacon Chain. 

**Phase 0** 

Ethereum 2.0 essentially boils down to creating a new blockchain from scratch with a new consensus mechanism (proof of stake) and new architecture (sharding) before porting all of Ethereum‚Äôs existing applications to the new chain without disruption. 

The **Beacon Chain** is Ethereum 2.0‚Äôs proof of stake blockchain. Where Ethereum is currently secured via Proof of Work miners, the Beacon Chain will be secured through Proof of Stake **validators.** Where proof of work involves running specialized hardware that consume vast quantities of electricity, proof of stake requires downloading some software and committing a stake of 32 ETH to a smart contract.

While the launch of the Beacon Chain will capture much of the excitement in the near future, outside of bootstrapping a network of proof of stake validators, this chain will have little functionality. Sharding and smart contract support will not be introduced until later phases.

Before Ethereum can port existing applications over to Ethereum 2.0, it‚Äôs next phase will need to launch which won‚Äôt occur until a year from now at the earliest.  

**Phase 1** 

Once Phase 0 has been completed and ETH 2.0‚Äôs validator set is firmly in place, **Phase 1** will implement new architecture for how the Beachon Chain stores data, called sharding. 

Currently, Ethereum full nodes must store a full history of every transaction that‚Äôs ever occurred and process every new transaction on the network. This makes running a full node onerous and is a primary source of Ethereum‚Äôs scaling woes.

Sharding will subdivide Ethereum‚Äôs Beacon Chain into 64 pieces, or ‚Äúshards‚Äù. Where nodes currently store data for the entire blockchain, each shard will have its own subset of nodes processing it. Sharding alone will scale Ethereum‚Äôs throughput by 64x. 

Even when sharding is implemented (possibly around this time next year), the entire Ethereum ecosystem will continue to run in parallel on the proof of work chain. 

**Phase 1.5 - ‚ÄúThe merge‚Äù** 

Once Ethereum‚Äôs Beacon Chain has a full set of PoS validators securing the network, and the chain has been subdivided into 64 parallel shards, then it will be time to merge Ethereum as we know it today into Ethereum 2.0. 

This will be accomplished by merging all of the smart contracts and transaction data from the PoW chain into a shard under the PoS chain. At this point, Ethereum will have successfully transitioned from proof of work to proof of stake.  

However, this will not take place until some time until 2022, so the earliest point in which the average Ethereum user today interacts with Ethereum 2.0 is at least one year away. 

**Phase 2 (that may never happen)** 

When the merge between Eth1 &amp; Eth2 takes place, all of the smart contracting execution will take place within a single shard on Eth2. 

The final phase of Ethereum 2.0, Phase 2, involves unlocking smart contract execution across some or all the Beacon Chain‚Äôs 64 shards. Additionally, phase 2 may introduce a new virtual machine. 

However, this phase may end up being unnecessary with phases 0-1.5 and the adoption of a layer-2 scaling technique called ‚Äúrollups.‚Äù Rollups are a type of layer 2 scaling technology that process transactions independently of the Ethereum blockchain, but settle snapshots of their state to the main chain. 

**Rollups + ‚ÄúPhase 1.5‚Äù would amount to a \~10,000x+ improvement in network processing capacity over the current state of Ethereum.** This means that if current layer-one protocols embrace rollups, Eth2 as it‚Äôs currently laid out may never fully launch, but Ethereum will reach its desired scalability within the next two years.

Non-Ethereum coin sent to Ethereum address,"Hello,

I recently worked with a client who accidentally sent a non-ERC20 coin to an Ethereum address.; specifically, it was ""Theta"". This coin was an ERC20 token until 2 years ago and was then moved to its native blockchain - unfortunately the developers kept the Ethereum public address format, so now most wallets and exchanges will not throw an error if THETA is being withdrawn to an ETH address.

&amp;#x200B;

Being in possession of the private key and seed, is there any way of retrieving the coin from the address? [THIS](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/how-to-recover-funds-sent-to-a-wrong-public-address/145) method was attempted, but without success. If the private key or seed is used to log into a Theta wallet, the wallet value shows 0 Theta (looking up the public key, however, shows the funds in the address).

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is not really a problem caused by Ethereum, but maybe someone here has another idea of how this could be resolved. I advised my client to also contact the THETA team directly.

"Why providing liquidity to Uniswap today is inefficient, and how we can make it more efficient"," Today, the liquidity providing market is full of inefficiencies, mainly:

* Impermanent loss is a big risk for liquidity providers. Many prefer to avoid that risk by earning lower yields in safer ways.
* When providing liquidity to a pair, the liquidity provider must provide the tokens in the exact ratio. For example, on Uniswap each pair is made of two tokens. The liquidity provider must provide 50% of the value with the first token and 50% with the second.
* LP tokens are not accepted as collateral by almost any lending market, even if they are backed by tokens that are usually accepted as collateral.

These are some of the reason that discourage potential liquidity providers to contribute to AMMs, and therefore the reason why, now, the liquidity providing market is suboptimal.

## A lending market designed for LP tokens

We (Impermax Finance) are building a lending market where borrowers can use the LP token of a pair as the collateral to borrow the assets that make up that pair. For instance, the LP token of the pair ETH/DAI can be used as collateral to borrow ETH and DAI..

We will be using an innovative collateralization model specifically designed for LP tokens that will take advantage of the fact that the collateral is backed directly by the assets borrowed. LP tokens holders will be able to leverage their investment and even multiply their yield by several factors.

The first AMM that we will add is Uniswap, and in particular we will support all the pairs supported by Uniswap V2. Read more about [the mechanics of our lending market](https://impermax.finance/a-lending-market-designed-for-the-lp-tokens-of-uniswap-and-other-amms/).

## Making liquidity providing more efficient

This kind of lending market will create a lot of new possibilities for liquidity providers. They will act as lenders or borrowers.

* Lender will be able to indirectly provide liquidity to the AMM, so earn a yield on any token supported by the AMM without any exposure to impermanent loss. Also, they won‚Äôt need any specific ratio of tokens to start investing but can provide as liquidity any number of tokens they prefer.
* Borrowers will be able to use all their LP tokens as collateral, and so use them to borrow assets and to buy more LP tokens, thus leveraging their yield. They will still be exposed to impermanent loss, but as Peter Ducker said: ‚ÄúAll profit is derived from risks‚Äù.

We‚Äôre giving liquidity providers the tools to adjust their risks by acting as either lenders or borrowers. We think that lending will attract more investors to the liquidity providing world as the risk introduced by the impermanent loss is removed. At the same time, we‚Äôre also giving the possibility to leverage a certain LP token when it may be undervalued. This will make the liquidity providing market a lot more efficient.

I'm developing a lending protocol completely based on Uniswap's liquidity pool tokens,"It will accept Uniswap's LP token as collateral in order to borrow the two tokens of the pair of that pool. It will use an innovative collateralization model that will allow to achieve high leverages on LP tokens at a low risk.

The most interesting thing is that this will open a new lending market for AMMs that will bring them more liquidity. Moreover, borrowers will be able to indirectly provide liquidity to AMMs without any exposure to impermanent loss! The whole liquidity providing market for AMMs will become more efficient as investors will have tools as leverage that will allow them to manage better their risks.

Possible EIP proposal: Elliptic SSS scheme,"Hi everyone!¬†

Would like to propose the solution for sharing the private key / other sensitive information with a modified SSS scheme.¬†

The key features are:
1) the secret restoration is not possible without corresponding signatures
2) share[i] belongs to privateKey[i] only, which means it can't be signed with a different private key

I hope this approach can help on the application level to share sensitive information or it can be used as m-of-n multi-signature (this is discussable). Here is the repo with a concept description and working example in node.js:¬†https://github.com/ega-forever/esss

Couple key points to remember when talking to people about ETH :) (in comparison to BTC),"YTD:

Bitcoin up 154% YTD

Ethereum up 291% YTD


All Time Highs (ATH):

Bitcoin ~5% away from reaching ATH

Ethereum ~58% away from reaching ATH (room to grow to where we know it‚Äôs been before and capable of going again!)


Speeds of confirmed transaction:

Bitcoin ~10 minutes

Ethereum ~  between 15seconds and 5 minutes


Verification methodology:

Bitcoin = Proof of Work (PoW). More on-hand capital (e.g. capital to pay for utilities such as electricity and hardware) allows for greater chance of mining blocks and verification

Ethereum = PoW moving to Proof of Stake (PoS) with ETH 2.0. More ETH ‚Äústaked‚Äù greater chance of verification and subsequent return. Requires more ‚Äúskin in game‚Äù as any illicit activity results in fines and/or loss of stake 


Coins ‚Äúon‚Äù other Chain:

Bitcoin = $0 ETH on BTC chain

Ethereum = $700M BTC (WBTC) on ETH chain 


Just remember, first to market does not always mean the best or most likely to succeed. BTC has its financial utility, but ETH has a wider variety of utility and an evolving framework. Hodl gang!",ethereum,1606136318,BoziRap,0,1,True,2020-11-23

So is ETH 2.0 going to create inflation or a massive increase in ETH supply come phase 2?,"I am confused about how the PoS ETH 2.0 rewards impact the economy. If I understand everything I have read correctly so far, ETH 1.0 PoW will continue to run parallel until Phase 2. 

So miners will continue to receive the same ETH 1.0 rewards until PoW is deactivated in Phase 2. While at the same time Stakers are receiving ETH 2.0 rewards between phases 0 &amp; 2. Doesn't this mean when Phase 2.0 hits there is going to be a massive flood of extra ETH in the ecosystem and potentially a price drop?

Transaction out of gas and address/wallet very low on ETH. What to do?,"Hi folks,

So I tried transferring some ERC-20 tokens (ZRX) from an address that had very little ETH on it, and I must have messed up the gas limit+price ( 31'000 limit with 29 gwei) because my transaction ran out of gas and now that address doesn't have enough ETH to do anything. ( 0**.**00002031 ETH left)

What is my best course of action here?

Could I mine enough for this one transaction in a day? I do have an RTX 3080 I can put to work.

Should I just buy ETH on an exchange and send it over? Seems like it would cost too much in exchange/withdrawal fees for just sending a tiny bit of ETH for gas..",ethereum,1606084070,gcsabbagh,3,1,True,2020-11-22

I know sparkpool for instance has come to resolutions when these mistakes have happened but it seems mph may be a 1 man team and in the wind at that.

Etheruem 2.0: A few things to clarify,"1. This will facilitate faster transactions and result in cheaper fees for transactions? from 15 a second to what?

3. DeFi has boomed under Ethereum. Will it expand or contract with Etheruem 2.0.

4. Will ethereum 2.0 allow for stable coins to make payments instantly at checkout lines or will the delay still be awkward? Could it allow for companies to step up and create payment hardware to compete with Visa/Mastercard?

Need an Ethereum Transaction Crawler app,"Hey guys, I have an assignment to do for my course, but I do not know how to do it. Does anyone know a good tutorial or lesson that would help me do this? Here is the assignment: 

Create an application that will collect data from the Ethereum blockchain about transactions associated with a specific wallet address that the user inputs. The app should get information on the wallets (addresses) and amounts of ETH associated with transactions made to and from a certain given wallet and either store them in a database of choice or show them in a simple human-readable way (ideally, through a web page). Collect transaction data starting from a given block (do not crawl the entire blockchain).

**Example**: If a user requests to view transactions associated with the address *0xaa7a9ca87d3694b5755f213b5d04094b8d0f0a6f* from block *9000000* to the current block it should be able to crawl and visualize all transaction data (addresses that sent to and received tokens from address *0xaa7a9ca87d3694b5755f213b5d04094b8d0f0a6f* , and how much ETH was used for a given transaction) in that period of time.

Completely forgot how to access my ETH coins. Please help...,"Hi Everyone,

I bought some ETH tokens back in 2017 on Coinbase and then decided to move it to a wallet? at the advise of my friend. It seems like I overcomplicated things for myself since retrieving them has become a mystery for me after 3 years...I think I remember using one or a combination these: MetaMask and MyEtherWallet.com

Here's what I still have:

Printout of something from MyEtherWallet.com which has two QR codes (my address and private key), as well as those two things in alphanumeric form.

I also saved a text file on my computer called MetaM.txt, which contains a series of 12 words, a string of 42 numbers/letters.

A file with a weirdass name (starts with UTC) and weird extension. I think this is the JSON file I saw someone mention in another post and that I shouldnt open it. (Unfortunately, I already did... didnt alter the file so not sure if that messed anything up)

I tried fumbling my way around the MetaMask addin and MyEtherWallet.com to recover my wallet/tokens but havent had any luck... either said wrong key or JSON or when something did look like it worked the amount of ETH says zero... so either my tokens got jacked somehow during that time or I'm doing something wrong. Can someone please point me in the right direction?

Easy setup of an ETH 2.0 staking node,"There are probably already some solutions to facilitate the setup of a staking node from scratch, so here is another one. Hopefully it helps to onboard more stakers during the testing phase.

For those who want to get a feeling for how it is to operate a staking node in a testnet right now, if you are a bit familiar with ansible, feel free to use and abuse this ansible role:

* [ethereum_validator on ansible-galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/maximilianmeister/ethereum_validator)
* [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/MaximilianMeister/ethereum-validator)

You can see it as an installer that automates manual steps to provision a server.

For the default scenario it is enough to have docker and molecule installed to run your node locally in a containerized environment.

The role can of course also be used to target a remote node for provisioning.

Thanks to /u/SomerEsat for the [great guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ju4rq4/psa_my_ethereum_20_staking_guides_medalla_testnet/) on how to set things up, and also thanks to all the others involved in making staking on the testnet such a good experience.",ethereum,1605731086,cryptoctl,1,2,True,2020-11-18

Do I have to put my private key in my ETH node? Is that safe?,"I know for ETH 2 you are supposed to be able to run a validator node, that makes a digital signature if the blocks in that shard are ok. I don't know if I understand correctly, but does that mean my account private key would need to be on the node software itself?

Like lets say I usually would use a hardware wallet for my funds, to make sure nobody can break into it. But now, in order for my account to be a validator, I need to be able to put that private key on the node itself. The node is obviously open to the internet, somebody might be able to break in and get the key right? I mean I guess I could make another account just for the node, but if my block rewards are going there, I would have to keep emptying it every time it makes some money in case somebody hacks the key.

At a certain point does it make more sense for the node to have its own private key, which is not an account key at all? Maybe the account key that put Eth to be a validator could sign another public key for its node to use, but that key that it signed, doesn't have any money itself. I don't know if that makes sense hahaha.

I'm curious if it works the way I think (node just has an account address and private key), or if the node has its own public key, and why it was decided to work that way.",ethereum,1605498033,halebass,10,18,True,2020-11-15

The opinion of someone who actually uses the Ethereum network like a regular bank.,"I use Ethereum weekly and I would easily say I'm someone whos here primarily for the usecase rather than an investment vehicle.

Im paid every week in Dai from my employer for the work I've completed that week. 

Defi is an awsome way to earn interest without having to go back to centralised services. 

However, the one thing that keeps me coming back to regular banks is privacy. I absolutely hate that my employer can see all my funds and I have to pay upwards of $20 to wash money through tornado cash everytime (while uniswap trades are below $5).

If it wasn't for the lack of privacy I would have literally no reason to ever leave the ecosystem and with PayPal payments coming soon I'll no longer need to buy giftcards to buy from non-crypto stores.

Its disappointing that the focus with L2s is 500+ TPS. $0.77 fees for transactions aren't even that much of an issue, it's slightly inconvenient but it's not off putting. Why can't L2s offer 50TPS but private transfer, it's privacy that's over priced not regular transfers.",ethereum,1605473301,KingNanoBunny,48,40,True,2020-11-15

Introducing Etherflow by QuikNode,"&gt;We've spent hundreds of hours talking to customers and understanding how they want to connect &amp; use their Ethereum nodes. But there is no way to cover every use-case a customer has, so we built a tool to help them get started in any programming language. And it's open source, too!

Read more: [https://blog.quiknode.io/introducing-etherflow-by-quiknode/](https://blog.quiknode.io/introducing-etherflow-by-quiknode/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We think of Etherflow as a node debugging tool, which can also help beginners get started. We currently support [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) and [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.0/), but will support many more clients like ethereum.rb, Web3.py, and cURL.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can access Etherflow for free at [etherflow.quiknode.io](http://etherflow.quiknode.io/) or clone/fork the repo from [https://github.com/abunsen/etherflow/](https://github.com/abunsen/etherflow/).

&amp;#x200B;

We're excited to finally release this tool into the wild, and see how the repo morphs &amp; evolves!

The Phase 0 voluntary exit is signed using the validator key and not the withdrawal key.,"[This problem](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1578) is beginning to emerge.
Third party staking services do not have the withdrawal key but they will still be able to do almost anything until the validator is slashed or leaks to 16 ETH without any way for the user to stop them since the voluntary exit request has to be signed with the validator -hot- key and not with the withdrawal key.

I think this is a poor design choice and it has been known for almost a year, the only way around this seems to be to request the third party staking services to give their users an already signed voluntary exit request for them to use if something bad happens but in the GitHub discussion linked above it seems that such signed request would become invalid after a few epochs.",ethereum,1605058828,mycryptotradeaccount,9,1,True,2020-11-10

Getting started with Solidity - First DApp?,"Hey, i am currently doing an ethereum-blockchain course at university and it's pretty interesting. We're supposed to implement a DApp now and we're allowed to think about a project on our own.

I wonder what would be a cool idea to get started with Solidity. I am kinda lost on what can be done and what might be too hard for a beginner. We don't really need to reinvent the wheel or do something that hasn't be done before.

Do you guys have any recommendations on what might a cool first project to work on? We were thinking about a decentralized voting / polling application but maybe there are other cool and interesting ideas.

Any Idea of how to get involved without coding?,"As many of the Ethereum-fans I am intrigued by the Blockchain-technology! First step forward surely would be to get involved... but I am not a coder. I know how to code in Python but I wouldn't call myself a good coder, I simply don't spend too much time with it, and it isn't my primary wish to learn javascript and solidity. 

I am trying to push the topic on my university and coming from economics I have written essays and works on the applications of Blockchain-Tech that would fill several Bachelor-Theses. But I wan't to be within the system, actually experiencing live whatever is developing and innovating around Blockchain-Tech and its non-Currency/Trading implications. So here to my question:

Does anybody know whether it is possible for someone like me to be useful within the Blockchain-Ecosystem and get on the forefront and if so where, or if I am best helping with spreading awareness for it and staying an attentive observer?",ethereum,1605027298,Phistofeles,1,1,True,2020-11-10

Why no stakers and how to fix it.,"This post is **not** about trading.

If you sold in 2013 peak, you would 10x your holding.

If you sold in 2017 peak, you would 10x your holding. 

But you probably didn't. You still have a chance, probably the last one, to sell at 2021(22?) peak.

**But if you stake, you will lose this last chance!** If the prices peak before 1.5 is released, you can't sell! If you've lost your last chance to 10x your capital, mere 20% is not much of consolation. That's why people are hesitant to stake.

Fortunately, it's fixable. The bull run will probably last for a year. It's long enough warning. Developers just have to prepare plan B: a two-way bridge or any other emergency escape hatch and release it when bull run is confirmed. **If developers publicly commit to it**, people won't be afraid to stake and 2.0 will release on time.",ethereum,1605036212,NZvolunarist,22,1,True,2020-11-10
