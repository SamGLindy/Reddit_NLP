BTC dominance Ôºàwhy this year is different?Ôºâ,"Hi
I read online, as well as youtube, that many people believe that this is the alt coin season for a few months, money flow from bitcoin to alt coins which would cause bitcoin dominance to decrease and altcoin price to booming(look at ETH). However, Bitcoin price will somehow stay at this level. 

Meanwhile, it seems no one is worried if bitcoin price will plummet as money leaves bitcoin....Now the BTC. D is below 50%. Last time this happened was Jan 2018. Also, Jan 2018, ETH is unhook from BTC price, just like now... 

Am I missing anything? Why do you think this bitcoin dominance fall is not a warning sign/big deal, which implys the market big crash?",Bitcoin,1619739110,AllenDo,14,True

Let me specify what I mean.

As Bitcoin's organic growth matures I've noticed a mega fuckload of powerful rich people, general media, and others throwing opinions out there trying to persuade everyone to look the opposite way of the revolution.

Case in point Elon Musk.  People are drawn to this guy and whatever he says.  I'm sure he has his own intentions and methodology on shit he's doing and that he understands Bitcoin.  Instead of being a positive influence and advancing the technology to better mankind, he shills a shitcoin!!  Doing that put idiots in a position to gamble and lose a ton of money.  That's very irresponsible for someone who's supposed to be doing good for mankind.

Aside from him we have media outlets who do ZERO research on the subject to try to get a better understanding and just come up with sensational titles to sway people's emotions which are effective.  How many times have you heard someone parrot the FUD that Bitcoin is bad for the environment without knowing all the facts and what it does for humanity.

In conclusion I just want to say that I fucking hate people.  Bitcoin could be much further than what it is right now if it weren't for these shit pied pipers at every damn corner.

The pillaging never ends: Large institutions now buying real estate in an already overheated market‚Ä¶. Bitcoin fixes this!,"I just receive my daily email from Marty Bent:

The pillaging never ends
 
‚ÄúSome of you freaks are probably well aware of the insane upward price pressure the US real estate market has been experiencing over the course of the last year. Everyone and their mother has a story of a family member or friend who has recently ventured into the housing market in hopes of buying a home for their family only to be met with the fact that they have to be ready to move very quickly and make an offer well above the listed asking price if they want to have any chance of actually getting a property. Many people I know personally are very stressed about the situation.

What is causing this? If I had to guess, it's being driven by the exodus from large cities to suburban areas that many are making as the concept of work from home becomes more popular in the aftermath of the forced lockdowns. Many are looking for more room and more peace and quiet outside of large metropolitan areas and they are scooping up a ton of suburban homes in the process.

Could this phenomenon be the sole factor driving up home prices at the rate that they're being driven up at this current moment? It seems a bit far fetched to believe that every individual who is leaving a city is able to purchase a home hundreds of thousands of dollars above the asking price. There has to be some other force contributing to the surge in home prices.

Well, there are many out there who are saying that many large institutions, the BlackRocks of the world, are out in force joining those families who are looking for starter homes in the market. They are not only joining, but they are aggressively attempting to front run individuals so they can securitize properties to package into specific REIT products. In the process, exacerbating a heated real estate market that only seems to be getting hotter by the day.

If these rumors are found to be true, they highlight a very dark side of a fiat monetary system that has created completely perverse incentives throughout our economy. A complete lack of a quality assets that exist to serve as stores of value has driven many to treat consumption goods like real estate as places to store wealth over time. Or worse, to aggressively speculate, which seems like many institutional investors may be doing at the moment with single family homes.

Access to cheap credit via capital injections and a suppression of interest rates gives these institutions the ability to load up ""cash"" and go on buying sprees. Scooping up as many single family homes as possible and packaging them into indexed products to sell to other speculators without having any intention of ever living in the homes. Money printed ex-nihilio is going to speculators who are pushing the ability for actual families to begin building quality lives in an affordable home. The system has completely fucked them once again. Sorry, plebs!

This madness needs to stop. And luckily for us, we have Bitcoin. Bitcoin renders the concept of non-productive real estate as a store of value obsolete and, in time, will return housing back to its rightful status as a consumption good. As more and more individuals realize the opportunity cost of storing value in a house over sats is significantly high due to the fact that housing deteriorates, has high upkeep costs, and can be easily confiscated by a government compared to bitcoin which is digital (therefore, cannot deteriorate), has extremely low (usually one-time) storage costs, and is significantly harder to confiscate; real estate prices will begin to reflect this reality and fall back down to earth.

With this massive repricing will come a shift away from wildly speculating in the real estate markets because institutional investors are attempting to guess where single families want to store their wealth. Another beneficial knock on effect from this repricing may be the resurgence of the middle class as housing becomes affordable for more people again. 

Until this repricing happens, the Cantillon insiders will continue to flood the real estate markets with cheap cash. Scooping up homes they never intend to live in and pricing hard working American families out of the market. We can only hope that more of the market begins to wake up to the fact that Bitcoin is a significantly better store of value.

With all that being said, it would be a bit poetic if the great value exodus out of the Frankenstein store of value assets that are most common today and into sats happens at a such a pace that makes it so these large institutions pricing out families get left holding the bag. ‚Äú",Bitcoin,1619754157,jboy69x,16,True

Unpopular Opinion.,"Out of boredom I googled how many millionares are there in the United States ...Answer 18.6 millionares. Mind you that is one country and includes billionares as well. If there is only 21 million bitcoin and we recognize Bitcoin as a global asset, this means in good time if the super wealthy dont beat the common folk to bitcoins and only half hold bitcoins, common folk, middle class, poor people can literally shoot to upper class as we've seen multiple people buy fan y cars and surreal homes. This just some simple math to help people understand why even the richest and down to earth investors are telling retail investors there's no reason why holding 1 percent of your holdings in bitcoin . Please let me know what you think about my thought process and if you think I'm a complete fool. HODL!",Bitcoin,1619759669,Hefty-Sugar-7983,9,True

"Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) vs Buying the ""Dip""","Hi all,

I have been learning about Bitcoin for the past few months and am trying to figure out the best investing strategy for myself. As an experiment, I analyzed and compared two strategies, DCA and Buying the ""Dip"" and I have some interesting results that I wanted to share with you guys.

**Disclaimer: This is not financial advice but for educational purposes only.**

**Period**: Between April 2020 and April 2021.

**Strategies**:

* **DCA** (weekly on Wednesday, bi-weekly on Wednesday, monthly on the 1st): Total $800/month
* **Buying the ""Dip:""** I define the ""dip"" here as when the price of Bitcoin drops to a certain threshold after its most recent all-time high (ATH). For all the periods that I am not investing, I am simply accumulating my USD. I am assuming that I will be able to add to my fund $500 twice a month, on the 15th and 30th. My investment fund will be divided into three parts and it will be invested as follow. I will invest 1/3 of my fund when BTC drops 20%, another 1/3 when BTC drops 50%, and the last 1/3 when BTC drops 65%. If for example, BTC drops 20% and bounces back to another ATH, I only use 1/3 of my investment and hold the 2/3 for the next dip.

To my surprise, all DCA strategies outperformed buying the ""dip"" by roughly 50%. Of course, hindsight is 20/20 and this is a very simplified model. No one can really time exactly when Bitcoin is going to drop. Invest smartly and only invest what you are willing to lose. Let me know if you have any suggestions on how I can improve my investing strategy.

Questions on how Bitcoin ETF theoretically work in the future if Bitcoin goes from SoV to means of exchange/mass adoption?,"Bought some BTC ETF‚Äôs but trying to wrap my head around long term plan.

Would one day you be able to redeem your shares for the equivalent of BTC to transfer to a wallet and spend or would it only be a store of value? The only way to transfer it and transact would be to sell it, buy it and store on a wallet? That would trigger capital gains and be ineffective.

What if the currency failed? (I.E buying with Canadian dollars) how would you cash it out?

How would you lend it out hypothetically if banks fail? I see Celsius and BlockFi but that‚Äôs risky per now and you need to have physical coins. But in the future it‚Äôs possible to get collateral based on holdings right? But what if banks are not around? 

Would it be easier for the government to confiscate? Since you buy in a registered account. What if the government went to war and central banks needed bitcoin and demanded resources? It would be easier technically instead of having a physical wallet?
Reading history governments fought wars over gold and in times lost possessions of land, assets, gold. 

I like Bitcoin ETF‚Äôs for only the convenience of storage and safety (like gold in a vault) but I‚Äôm pondering the above.

Worried about taxes in registered accounts when one day the goal is to spend it. Would like to hear thoughts",Bitcoin,1619760978,SimplyShred,2,True
